      "</div>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">Lord Kelvin writing in 1893, in his preface to the English edition of Hertz’s Researches on Electric Waves, says “many workers and many thinkers have helped to build up the nineteenth century school of <i>plenum</i>, one ether for light, heat, electricity, magnetism; and the German and English volumes containing Hertz’s electrical papers, given to the world in the last decade of the century, will be a permanent monument of the splendid consummation now realised.”</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Ten years later, in 1905, we find Einstein declaring that “the ether will be proved to be superfluous.” At first sight the revolution in scientific thought brought about in the course of a single decade appears to be almost too violent. A more careful even though a rapid review of the subject will, however, show how the Theory of Relativity gradually became a historical necessity.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Towards the beginning of the nineteenth century, the luminiferous ether came into prominence as a result of the brilliant successes of the wave theory in the hands of Young and Fresnel. In its stationary aspect the elastic solid ether was the outcome of the search for a medium in which the light waves may “undulate.” This stationary ether, as shown by Young, also afforded a satisfactory explanation of astronomical aberration. But its very success gave rise to a host of new questions all bearing on the central problem of relative motion of ether and matter.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\"><i>Arago’s prism experiment.</i>—The refractive index of a glass prism depends on the incident velocity of light outside the prism and its velocity inside the prism after refraction. On Fresnel’s fixed ether hypothesis, the incident light waves are situated in the stationary ether outside the prism and move with velocity <i>c</i> with respect to the ether. If the prism moves with a velocity <i>u</i> with respect to this fixed ether, then the incident velocity of light with respect to the prism should be <i>c</i> + <i>u</i>. Thus the refractive index of the glass prism should depend on <i>u</i> the absolute velocity of the prism, <i>i.e.</i>, its velocity with respect to the fixed ether. Arago performed the experiment in 1819, but failed to detect the expected change.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\"><i>Airy-Boscovitch water-telescope experiment.</i>—Boscovitch had still earlier in 1766, raised the very important question of the dependence of aberration on the refractive index of the medium filling the telescope. Aberration depends on the difference in the velocity of light outside the telescope and its velocity inside the telescope. If the latter velocity changes owing to a change in the medium filling the telescope, aberration itself should change, that is, aberration should depend on the nature of the medium.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Airy, in 1871 filled up a telescope with water—but failed to detect any change in the aberration. Thus we get both in the case of Arago prism experiment and Airy-Boscovitch water-telescope experiment, the very startling result that optical effects in a moving medium seem to be quite independent of the velocity of the medium with respect to Fresnel’s stationary ether.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\"><i>Fresnel’s convection coefficient k = 1 - 1/μ<sup>2</sup>.</i>—Possibly some form of compensation is taking place. Working on this hypothesis, Fresnel offered his famous ether convection theory. According to Fresnel, the presence of matter implies a definite condensation of ether within the region occupied by matter. This “condensed” or excess portion of ether is supposed to be carried away with its own piece of moving matter. It should be observed that only the “excess” portion is carried away, while the rest remains as stagnant as ever. A complete convection of the “excess” ether ρ′ with the full velocity <i>u</i> is optically equivalent to a partial convection of the total ether ρ, with only a fraction of the velocity <i>k</i>. <i>u</i>. Fresnel showed that if this convection coefficient <i>k</i> is 1 - 1/μ<sup>2</sup> (μ being the refractive index of the prism), then the velocity of light after refraction within the moving prism would be altered to just such extent as would make the refractive index of the moving prism quite independent of its “absolute” velocity <i>u</i>. The non-dependence of aberration on the “absolute” velocity <i>u</i>, is also very easily explained with the help of this Fresnelian convection-coefficient <i>k</i>.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\"><i>Stokes’ viscous ether.</i>—It should be remembered, however, that Fresnel’s stationary ether is absolutely fixed and is not at all disturbed by the motion of matter through it. In this respect Fresnelian ether cannot be said to behave in any respectable physical fashion, and this led Stokes, in 1845-46, to construct a more material type of medium. Stokes assumed that viscous motion ensues near the surface of separation of ether and moving matter, while at sufficiently distant regions the ether remains wholly undisturbed. He showed how such a viscous ether would explain aberration if all motion in it were differentially irrotational. But in order to explain the null Arago effect, Stokes was compelled to assume the convection hypothesis of Fresnel with an identical numerical value for <i>k</i>, namely 1 - 1/μ<sup>2</sup>. Thus the prestige of the Fresnelian convection-coefficient was enhanced, if anything, by the theoretical investigations of Stokes.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\"><i>Fizeau’s experiment.</i>—Soon after, in 1851, it received direct experimental confirmation in a brilliant piece of work by Fizeau.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">If a divided beam of light is re-united after passing through two adjacent cylinders filled with water, ordinary interference fringes will be produced. If the water in one of the cylinders is now made to flow, the “condensed” ether within the flowing water would be convected and would produce a shift in the interference fringes. The shift actually observed agreed very well with a value of k = 1 - 1/μ<sup>2</sup>. The Fresnelian convection-coefficient now became firmly established as a consequence of a direct positive effect. On the other hand, the negative evidences in favour of the convection-coefficient had also multiplied. Mascart, Hoek, Maxwell and others sought for definite changes in different optical effects induced by the motion of the earth relative to the stationary ether. But all such attempts failed to reveal the slightest trace of any optical disturbance due to the “absolute” velocity of the earth, thus proving conclusively that all the different optical effects shared in the general compensation arising out of the Fresnelian convection of the excess ether. It must be carefully noted that the Fresnelian convection-coefficient implicitly assumes the existence of a fixed ether (Fresnel) or at least a wholly stagnant medium at sufficiently distant regions (Stokes), with reference to which alone a convection velocity can have any significance. Thus the convection-coefficient implying some type of a stationary or viscous, yet nevertheless “absolute” ether, succeeded in explaining satisfactorily all known optical facts down to 1880.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\"><i>Michelson-Morley Experiment.</i>—In 1881, Michelson and Morley performed their classical experiments which undermined the whole structure of the old ether theory and thus served to introduce the new theory of relativity. The fundamental idea underlying this experiment is quite simple. In all old experiments the velocity of light situated in free ether was compared with the velocity of waves actually situated in a piece of moving matter and presumably carried away by it. The compensatory effect of the Fresnelian convection of ether afforded a satisfactory explanation of all negative results.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">In the Michelson-Morley experiment the arrangement is quite different. If there is a definite gap in a rigid body, light waves situated in free ether will take a definite time in crossing the gap. If the rigid platform carrying the gap is set in motion with respect to the ether in the direction of light propagation, light waves (which are even now situated in free ether) should presumably take a longer time to cross the gap.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We cannot do better than quote Eddington’s description of this famous experiment. “The principle of the experiment may be illustrated by considering a swimmer in a river. It is easily realized that it takes longer to swim to a point 50 yards up-stream and back than to a point 50 yards across-stream and back. If the earth is moving through the ether there is a river of ether flowing through the laboratory, and a wave of light may be compared to a swimmer travelling with constant velocity relative to the current. If, then, we divide a beam of light into two parts, and send one-half swimming up the stream for a certain distance and then (by a mirror) back to the starting point, and send the other half an equal distance across stream and back, the across-stream beam should arrive back first.</p>\r\n",

      "<p class=\"c005\">Let the ether be flowing relative to the apparatus with velocity <i>u</i> in the direction O<i>x</i>, and let OA, OB, be the two arms of the apparatus of equal length <i>l</i>, OA being placed up-stream.

      "<p class=\"c005\">For the transverse journey the light must have a component velocity <i>n</i> up-stream (relative to the ether) in order to avoid being carried below OB: and since its total velocity is <i>c</i>, its component across-stream must be √(<i>c²</i> - <i>u²</i>), the time for the double journey OB is accordingly</p>\r\n",

      "<p class=\"c005\">so that <i>t₁</i> &gt; <i>t₂</i>.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">But when the experiment was tried, it was found that both parts of the beam took the same time, as tested by the interference bands produced.”</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">After a most careful series of observations, Michelson and Morley failed to detect the slightest trace of any effect due to earth’s motion through ether.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The Michelson-Morley experiment seems to show that there is no relative motion of ether and matter. Fresnel’s stagnant ether requires a relative velocity of—<i>u</i>. Thus Michelson and Morley themselves thought at first that their experiment confirmed Stokes’ viscous ether, in which no relative motion can ensue on account of the absence of slipping of ether at the surface of separation. But even on Stokes’ theory this viscous flow of ether would fall off at a very rapid rate as we recede from the surface of separation. Michelson and Morley repeated their experiment at different heights from the surface of the earth, but invariably obtained the same negative results, thus failing to confirm Stokes’ theory of viscous flow.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\"><i>Lodge’s experiment.</i>—Further, in 1893, Lodge performed his rotating sphere experiment which showed complete absence of any viscous flow of ether due to moving masses of matter. A divided beam of light, after repeated reflections within a very narrow gap between two massive hemispheres, was allowed to re-unite and thus produce interference bands. When the two hemispheres are set rotating, it is conceivable that the ether in the gap would be disturbed due to viscous flow, and any such flow would be immediately detected by a disturbance of the interference bands. But actual observation failed to detect the slightest disturbance of the ether in the gap, due to the motion of the hemispheres. Lodge’s experiment thus seems to show a complete absence of any viscous flow of ether.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Apart from these experimental discrepancies, grave theoretical objections were urged against a viscous ether. Stokes himself had shown that his ether must be incompressible and all motion in it differentially irrotational, at the same time there should be absolutely no slipping at the surface of separation. Now all these conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied for any conceivable material medium without certain very special and arbitrary assumptions. Thus Stokes’ ether failed to satisfy the very motive which had led Stokes to formulate it, namely, the desirability of constructing a “physical” medium. Planck offered modified forms of Stokes’ theory which seemed capable of being reconciled with the Michelson-Morley experiment, but required very special assumptions. The very complexity and the very arbitrariness of these assumptions prevented Planck’s ether from attaining any degree of practical importance in the further development of the subject.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The sole criterion of the value of any scientific theory must ultimately be its capacity for offering a simple, unified, coherent and fruitful description of observed facts. In proportion as a theory becomes complex it loses in usefulness—a theory which is obliged to requisition a whole array of arbitrary assumptions in order to explain special facts is practically worse than useless, as it serves to disjoin, rather than to unite, the several groups of facts. The optical experiments of the last quarter of the nineteenth century showed the impossibility of constructing a simple ether theory, which would be amenable to analytic treatment and would at the same time stimulate further progress. It should be observed that it could scarcely be shown that no logically consistent ether theory was possible; indeed in 1910, H. A. Wilson offered a consistent ether theory which was at least quite neutral with respect to all available optical data. But Wilson’s ether is almost wholly negative—its only virtue being that it does not directly contradict observed facts. Neither any direct confirmation nor a direct refutation is possible and it does not throw any light on the various optical phenomena. A theory like this being practically useless stands self-condemned.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We must now consider the problem of relative motion of ether and matter from the point of view of electrical theory. From 1860 the identity of light as an electromagnetic vector became gradually established as a result of the brilliant “displacement current” hypothesis of Clerk Maxwell and his further analytical investigations. The elastic solid ether became gradually transformed into the electromagnetic one. Maxwell succeeded in giving a fairly satisfactory account of all ordinary optical phenomena and little room was left for any serious doubts as regards the general validity of Maxwell’s theory. Hertz’s researches on electric waves, first carried out in 1886, succeeded in furnishing a strong experimental confirmation of Maxwell’s theory. Electric waves behaved generally like light waves of very large wave length.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The orthodox Maxwellian view located the dielectric polarisation in the electromagnetic ether which was merely a transformation of Fresnel’s stagnant ether. The magnetic polarisation was looked upon as wholly secondary in origin, being due to the relative motion of the dielectric tubes of polarisation. On this view the Fresnelian convection coefficient comes out to be ½, as shown by J. J. Thomson in 1880, instead of 1 - (1/μ²) as required by optical experiments. This obviously implies a complete failure to account for all those optical experiments which depend for their satisfactory explanation on the assumption of a value for the convection coefficient equal to 1 - (1/μ²).</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The modifications proposed independently by Hertz and Heaviside fare no better.<a id=\"r1\"></a><a href=\"#f1\" class=\"c007 pginternal\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> They postulated the actual medium to be the seat of all electric polarisation and further emphasised the reciprocal relation subsisting between electricity and magnetism, thus making the field equations more symmetrical. On this view the whole of the polarised ether is carried away by the moving medium, and consequently, the convection coefficient naturally becomes unity in this theory, a value quite as discrepant as that obtained on the original Maxwellian assumption.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Thus neither Maxwell’s original theory nor its subsequent modifications as developed by Hertz and Heaviside succeeded in obtaining a value for Fresnelian coefficient equal to 1 - (1/μ<sup>2</sup>), and consequently stood totally condemned from the optical point of view.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Certain direct electromagnetic experiments involving relative motion of polarised dielectrics were no less conclusive against the generalised theory of Hertz and Heaviside. According to Hertz a moving dielectric would carry away the whole of its electric displacement with it. Hence the electromagnetic effect near the moving dielectric would be proportional to the total electric displacement, that is to K, the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric. In 1901, Blondlot working with a stream of moving gas could not detect any such effect. H. A. Wilson repeated the experiment in an improved form in 1903 and working with ebonite found that the observed effect was proportional to K - 1 instead of to K. For gases K is nearly equal to 1 and hence practically no effect will be observed in their case. This gives a satisfactory explanation of Blondlot’s negative results.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Rowland had shown in 1876 that the magnetic force due to a rotating condenser (the dielectric remaining stationary) was proportional to K, the sp. ind. cap. On the other hand, Röntgen found in 1888 the magnetic effect due to a rotating dielectric (the condenser remaining stationary) to be proportional to K - 1, and not to K. Finally Eichenwald in 1903 found that when both condenser and dielectric are rotated together, the effect observed was quite independent of K, a result quite consistent with the two previous experiments. The Rowland effect proportional to K, together with the opposite Röntgen effect proportional to 1 - K, makes the Eichenwald effect independent of K.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">All these experiments together with those of Blondlot and Wilson made it clear that the electromagnetic effect due to a moving dielectric was proportional to K - 1, and not to K as required by Hertz’s theory. Thus the above group of experiments with moving dielectrics directly contradicted the Hertz-Heaviside theory. The internal discrepancies inherent in the classic ether theory had now become too prominent. It was clear that the ether concept had finally outgrown its usefulness. The observed facts had become too contradictory and too heterogeneous to be reduced to an organised whole with the help of the ether concept alone. Radical departures from the classical theory had become absolutely necessary.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">There were several outstanding difficulties in connection with anomalous dispersion, selective reflection and selective absorption which could not be satisfactory explained in the classic electromagnetic theory. It was evident that the assumption of some kind of discreteness in the optical medium had become inevitable. Such an assumption naturally gave rise to an atomic theory of electricity, namely, the modern electron theory. Lorentz had postulated the existence of electrons so early as 1878, but it was not until some years later that the electron theory became firmly established on a satisfactory basis.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Lorentz assumed that a moving dielectric merely carried away its own “polarisation doublets,” which on his theory gave rise to the induced field proportional to K - 1. The field near a moving dielectric is naturally proportional to K - 1 and not to K. Lorentz’s theory thus gave a satisfactory explanation of all those experiments with moving dielectrics which required effects proportional to K - 1. Lorentz further succeeded in obtaining a value for the Fresnelian convection coefficient equal to 1 - 1/μ<sup>2</sup>, the exact value required by all optical experiments of the moving type.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We must now go back to Michelson and Morley’s experiment. We have seen that both parts of the beam are situated in free ether; no material medium is involved in any portion of the paths actually traversed by the beam. Consequently no compensation due to Fresnelian convection of ether by moving medium is possible. Thus Fresnelian convection compensation can have no possible application in this case. Yet some marvellous compensation has evidently taken place which has completely masked the “absolute” velocity of the earth.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">In Michelson and Morley’s experiment, the distance travelled by the beam along OA (that is, in a direction parallel to the motion of the platform) is 2<i>l</i>β², while the distance travelled by the beam along OB, perpendicular to the direction of motion of the platform, is 2<i>l</i>β. Yet the most careful experiments showed, as Eddington says, “that both parts of the beam took the same time as tested by the interference bands produced. It would seem that OA and OB could not really have been of the same length; and if OB was of length <i>l</i>, OA must have been of length <i>l</i>/β. The apparatus was now rotated through 90°, so that OB became the up-stream. The time for the two journeys was again the same, so that 0B must now be the shorter length. The plain meaning of the experiment is that both arms have a length <i>l</i> when placed along O<i>y</i> (perpendicular to the direction of motion), and automatically contract to a length <i>l</i>/β, when placed along O<i>x</i> (parallel to the direction of motion). This explanation was first given by Fitz-Gerald.”</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">This Fitz-Gerald contraction, startling enough in itself, does not suffice. Assuming this contraction to be a real one, the distance travelled with respect to the ether is 2<i>l</i>β and the time taken for this journey is 2<i>l</i>β/<i>c</i>. But the distance travelled with respect to the platform is always 2<i>l</i>. Hence the velocity of light with respect to the platform is</p>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"figcenter id002\"><img src=\"images/form-004.png\" alt=\"Formula.\" class=\"ig001\"></div>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">a variable quantity depending on the “absolute” velocity of the platform. But no trace of such an effect has ever been found. The velocity of light is always found to be quite independent of the velocity of the platform. The present difficulty cannot be solved by any further alteration in the measure of space. The only recourse left open is to alter the measure of time as well, that is, to adopt the concept of “local time.” If a moving clock goes slower so that one ‘real’ second becomes 1/β second as measured in the moving system, the velocity of light relative to the platform will always remain <i>c</i>. We must adopt two very startling hypotheses, namely, the Fitz-Gerald contraction and the concept of “local time,” in order to give a satisfactory explanation of the Michelson-Morley experiment.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">These results were already reached by Lorentz in the course of further developments of his electron theory. Lorentz used a special set of transformation equations<a id=\"r2\"></a><a href=\"#f2\" class=\"c007 pginternal\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> for time which implicitly introduced the concept of local time. But he himself failed to attach any special significance to it, and looked upon it rather as a mere mathematical artifice like imaginary quantities in analysis or the circle at infinity in projective geometry. The originality of Einstein at this stage consists in his successful physical interpretation of these results, and viewing them as the coherent organised consequences of a single general principle. Lorentz established the Relativity Theorem<a id=\"r3\"></a><a href=\"#f3\" class=\"c007 pginternal\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> (consisting merely of a set of transformation equations) while Einstein generalised it into a Universal Principle. In addition Einstein introduced fundamentally new concepts of space and time, which served to destroy old fetishes and demanded a wholesale revision of scientific concepts and thus opened up new possibilities in the synthetic unification of natural processes.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Newton had framed his laws of motion in such a way as to make them quite independent of the absolute velocity of the earth. Uniform relative motion of ether and matter could not be detected with the help of dynamical laws. According to Einstein neither could it be detected with the help of optical or electromagnetic experiments. Thus the Einsteinian Principle of Relativity asserts that all physical laws are independent of the ‘absolute’ velocity of an observer.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">For different systems, the <i>form</i> of all physical laws is conserved. If we chose the velocity of light<a id=\"r4\"></a><a href=\"#f4\" class=\"c007 pginternal\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> to be the fundamental unit of measurement for all observers (that is, assume the constancy of the velocity of light in all systems) we can establish a <i>metric</i> “one-one” correspondence between any two observed systems, such correspondence depending only the <i>relative</i> velocity of the two systems. Einstein’s Relativity is thus merely the consistent logical application of the well known physical principle that we can know nothing but <i>relative</i> motion. In this sense it is a further extension of Newtonian Relativity.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">On this interpretation, the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction and “local time” lose their arbitrary character. Space and time as measured by two different observers are naturally diverse, and the difference depends only on their relative motion. Both are equally valid; they are merely different descriptions of the same physical reality. This is essentially the point of view adopted by Minkowski. He considers time itself to be one of the co-ordinate axes, and in his four-dimensional world, that is in the space-time reality, relative motion is reduced to a rotation of the axes of reference. Thus, the diversity in the measurement of lengths and temporal rates is merely due to the static difference in the “frame-work” of the different observers.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The above theory of Relativity absorbed practically the whole of the electromagnetic theory based on the Maxwell-Lorentz system of field equations. It combined all the advantages of classic Maxwellian theory together with an electronic hypothesis. The Lorentz assumption of polarisation doublets had furnished a satisfactory explanation of the Fresnelian convection of ether, but in the new theory this is deduced merely as a consequence of the altered concept of relative velocity. In addition, the theory of Relativity accepted the results of Michelson and Morley’s experiments as a definite principle, namely, the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, so that there was nothing left for explanation in the Michelson-Morley experiment. But even more than all this, it established a single general principle which served to connect together in a simple coherent and fruitful manner the known facts of Physics.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The theory of Relativity received direct experimental confirmation in several directions. Repeated attempts were made to detect the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction. Any ordinary physical contraction will usually have observable physical results; for example, the total electrical resistance of a conductor will diminish. Trouton and Noble, Trouton and Rankine, Rayleigh and Brace, and others employed a variety of different methods to detect the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction, but invariably with the same negative results. <i>Whether there is an ether or not, uniform velocity with respect to it can never be detected.</i> This does not prove that there is no such thing as an ether but certainly does render the ether entirely superfluous. Universal compensation is due to a change in local units of length and time, or rather, being merely different descriptions of the same reality, there is no compensation at all.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">There was another group of observed phenomena which could scarcely be fitted into a Newtonian scheme of dynamics without doing violence to it. The experimental work of Kaufmann, in 1901, made it abundantly clear that the “mass” of an electron depended on its velocity. So early as 1881, J. J. Thomson had shown that the inertia of a charged particle increased with its velocity. Abraham now deduced a formula for the variation of mass with velocity, on the hypothesis that an electron always remained a <i>rigid</i> sphere. Lorentz proceeded on the assumption that the electron shared in the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction and obtained a totally different formula. A very careful series of measurements carried out independently by Bücherer, Wolz, Hupka and finally Neumann in 1913, decided conclusively in favour of the Lorentz formula. This “contractile” formula follows immediately as a direct consequence of the new Theory of Relativity, without any assumption as regards the electrical origin of inertia. Thus the complete agreement of experimental facts with the predictions of the new theory must be considered as confirming it as a principle which goes even beyond the electron itself. The greatest triumph of this new theory consists, indeed, in the fact that a large number of results, which had formerly required all kinds of special hypotheses for their explanation, are now deduced very simply as inevitable consequences of one single general principle.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We have now traced the history of the development of the restricted or special theory of Relativity, which is mainly concerned with optical and electrical phenomena. It was first offered by Einstein in 1905. Ten years later, Einstein formulated his second theory, the Generalised Principle of Relativity. This new theory is mainly a theory of gravitation and has very little connection with optics and electricity. In one sense, the second theory is indeed a further generalisation of the restricted principle, but the former does not really contain the latter as a special case.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Einstein’s first theory is restricted in the sense that it only refers to uniform rectilinear motion and has no application to any kind of accelerated movements. Einstein in his second theory extends the Relativity Principle to cases of accelerated motion. If Relativity is to be universally true, then even accelerated motion must be merely <i>relative motion between matter and matter</i>. Hence the Generalised Principle of Relativity asserts that “absolute” motion cannot be detected even with the help of gravitational laws.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">All movements must be referred to definite sets of co-ordinate axes. If there is any change of axes, the numerical magnitude of the movements will also change. But according to Newtonian dynamics, such alteration in physical movements can only be due to the effect of certain forces in the field.<a id=\"r5\"></a><a href=\"#f5\" class=\"c007 pginternal\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Thus any change of axes will introduce new “geometrical” forces in the field which are quite independent of the nature of the body acted on. Gravitational forces also have this same remarkable property, and gravitation itself may be of essentially the same nature as these “geometrical” forces introduced by a change of axes. This leads to Einstein’s famous Principle of Equivalence. <i>A gravitational field of force is strictly equivalent to one introduced by a transformation of co-ordinates and no possible experiment can distinguish between the two.</i></p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Thus it may become possible to “transform away” gravitational effects, at least for sufficiently small regions of space, by referring all movements to a new set of axes. This new “framework” may of course have all kinds of very complicated movements when referred to the old Galilean or “rectangular unaccelerated system of co-ordinates.”</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">But there is no reason why we should look upon the Galilean system as more fundamental than any other. If it is found simpler to refer all motion in a gravitational field to a special set of co-ordinates, we may certainly look upon this special “framework” (at least for the particular region concerned), to be more fundamental and more natural. We may, still more simply, identify this particular framework with the special local properties of space in that region. That is, we can look upon the effects of a gravitational field as simply due to the local properties of space and time itself. The very presence of matter implies a modification of the characteristics of space and time in its neighbourhood. As Eddington says “matter does not cause the curvature of space-time. It is the curvature. Just as light does not cause electromagnetic oscillations; it is the oscillations.”</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We may look upon this from a slightly different point of view. The General Principle of Relativity asserts that all motion is merely relative motion between matter and matter, and as all movements must be referred to definite sets of co-ordinates, the ground of any possible framework must ultimately be material in character. It <i>is</i> convenient to take the matter actually present in a field as the fundamental ground of our framework. If this is done, the special characteristics of our framework would naturally depend on the actual distribution of matter in the field. But physical space and time is completely defined by the “framework.” In other words the “framework” itself <i>is</i> space and time. Hence we see how <i>physical</i> space and time is actually defined by the local distribution of matter.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">There are certain magnitudes which remain constant by any change of axes. In ordinary geometry distance between two points is one such magnitude; so that δ<i>x²</i> + δ<i>y²</i> + δ<i>z²</i> is an invariant. In the restricted theory of light, the principle of constancy of light velocity demands that δ<i>x²</i> + δ<i>y²</i> + δ<i>z²</i> - <i>c²</i>δ<i>t²</i> should remain constant.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The <i>separation ds</i> of adjacent events is defined by <i>ds²</i> = -<i>dx²</i> - <i>dy²</i> - <i>dz²</i> + <i>c²dt²</i>. It is an extension of the notion of distance and this is the new invariant. Now if <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i> are transformed to any set of new variables <i>x₁</i>, <i>x₂</i>, <i>x₃</i>, <i>x₄</i>, we shall get a quadratic expression for</p>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"figcenter id004\"><img src=\"images/form-005.png\" alt=\"Formula.\" class=\"ig001\"></div>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">where the <i>g</i>’s are functions of <i>x₁</i>, <i>x₂</i>, <i>x₃</i>, <i>x₄</i> depending on the transformation.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The special properties of space and time in any region are defined by these <i>g</i>’s which are themselves determined by the actual distribution of matter in the locality. Thus from the Newtonian point of view, these <i>g</i>’s represent the gravitational effect of matter while from the Relativity stand-point, these merely define the non-Newtonian (and incidentally non-Euclidean) space in the neighbourhood of matter.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We have seen that Einstein’s theory requires local curvature of space-time in the neighbourhood of matter. Such altered characteristics of space and time give a satisfactory explanation of an outstanding discrepancy in the observed advance of perihelion of Mercury. The large discordance is almost completely removed by Einstein’s theory.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Again, in an intense gravitational field, a beam of light will be affected by the local curvature of space, so that to an observer who is referring all phenomena to a Newtonian system, the beam of light will appear to deviate from its path along an Euclidean straight line.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">This famous prediction of Einstein about the deflection of a beam of light by the sun’s gravitational field was tested during the total solar eclipse of May, 1919. The observed deflection is decisively in favour of the Generalised Theory of Relativity.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">It should be noted however that the velocity of light itself would decrease in a gravitational field. This may appear at first sight to be a violation of the principle of constancy of light-velocity. But when we remember that the Special Theory is explicitly <i>restricted</i> to the case of unaccelerated motion, the difficulty vanishes. In the absence of a gravitational field, that is in any unaccelerated system, the velocity of light will always remain constant. Thus the validity of the Special Theory is completely preserved within its own <i>restricted</i> field.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Einstein has proposed a third crucial test. He has predicted a shift of spectral lines towards the red, due to an intense gravitational potential. Experimental difficulties are very considerable here, as the shift of spectral lines is a complex phenomenon. Evidence is conflicting and nothing conclusive can yet be asserted. Einstein thought that a gravitational displacement of the Fraunhofer lines is a necessary and fundamental condition for the acceptance of his theory. But Eddington has pointed out that even if this test fails, the logical conclusion would seem to be that while Einstein’s law of gravitation is true for matter in bulk, it is not true for such small material systems as atomic oscillator.</p>\r\n",
      "<h3 class=\"c008\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">From the conceptual stand-point there are several important consequences of the Generalised or Gravitational Theory of Relativity. Physical space-time is perceived to be intimately connected with the actual local distribution of matter. Euclid-Newtonian space-time is <i>not</i> the actual space-time of Physics, simply because the former completely neglects the actual presence of matter. Euclid-Newtonian continuum is merely an abstraction, while physical space-*time is the actual framework which has some definite curvature due to the presence of matter. Gravitational Theory of Relativity thus brings out clearly the fundamental distinction between actual physical space-time (which is non-isotropic and non-Euclid-Newtonian) on one hand and the abstract Euclid-Newtonian continuum (which is homogeneous, isotropic and a purely intellectual construction) on the other.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The measurements of the rotation of the earth reveals a fundamental framework which may be called the “inertial framework.” This constitutes the actual physical universe. This universe approaches Galilean space-time at a great distance from matter.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The properties of this physical universe may be referred to some world-distribution of matter or the “inertial framework” may be constructed by a suitable modification of the law of gravitation itself. In Einstein’s theory the actual curvature of the “inertial framework” is referred to vast quantities of undetected world-matter. It has interesting consequences. The dimensions of Einsteinian universe would depend on the quantity of matter in it; it would vanish to a point in the total absence of matter. Then again curvature depends on the quantity of matter, and hence in the presence of a sufficient quantity of matter space-time may curve round and close up. Einsteinian universe will then reduce to a finite system without boundaries, like the surface of a sphere. In this “closed up” system, light rays will come to a focus after travelling round the universe and we should see an “anti-sun” (corresponding to the back surface of the sun) at a point in the sky opposite to the real sun. This anti-sun would of course be equally large and equally bright if there is no absorption of light in free space.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">In de Sitter’s theory, the existence of vast quantities of world-matter is not required. But beyond a definite distance from an observer, time itself stands still, so that to the observer nothing can ever “happen” there. All these theories are still highly speculative in character, but they have certainly extended the scope of theoretical physics to the central problem of the ultimate nature of the universe itself.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">One outstanding peculiarity still attaches to the concept of electric force—it is not amenable to any process of being “transformed away” by a suitable change of framework. H. Weyl, it seems, has developed a geometrical theory (in hyper-space) in which no fundamental distinction is made between gravitational and electrical forces.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Einstein’s theory connects up the law of gravitation with the laws of motion, and serves to establish a very intimate relationship between matter and physical space-*time. Space, time and matter (or energy) were considered to be the three ultimate elements in Physics. The restricted theory fused space-time into one indissoluble whole. The generalised theory has further synthesised space-time and matter into one fundamental physical reality. Space, time and matter taken separately are more abstractions. Physical reality consists of a synthesis of all three.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\"><span class=\"sc\">P. C. Mahalanobis.</span></p>\r\n",
      "<h3 class=\"c008\" id=\"note-a\">Note A.</h3>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">For example consider a massive particle resting on a circular disc. If we set the disc rotating, a centrifugal force appears in the field. On the other hand, if we transform to a set of rotating axes, we must introduce a centrifugal force in order to correct for the change of axes. This newly introduced centrifugal force is usually looked upon as a mathematical fiction—as “geometrical” rather than physical. The presence of such a geometrical force is usually interpreted as being due to the adoption of a fictitious framework. On the other hand a gravitational force is considered quite real. Thus a fundamental distinction is made between geometrical and gravitational forces.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">In the General Theory of Relativity, this fundamental distinction is done away with. The very possibility of distinguishing between geometrical and gravitational forces is denied. All axes of reference may now be regarded as equally valid.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">In the Restricted Theory, all “unaccelerated” axes of reference were recognised as equally valid, so that physical laws were made independent of uniform absolute velocity. In the General Theory, physical laws are made independent of “absolute” motion of any kind.</p>\r\n",

      "<h3 class=\"c008\">INTRODUCTION.</h3>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">It is well known that if we attempt to apply Maxwell’s electrodynamics, as conceived at the present time, to moving bodies, we are led to asymmetry which does not agree with observed phenomena. Let us think of the mutual action between a magnet and a conductor. The observed phenomena in this case depend only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, while according to the usual conception, a distinction must be made between the cases where the one or the other of the bodies is in motion. If, for example, the magnet moves and the conductor is at rest, then an electric field of certain energy-value is produced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, which excites a current in those parts of the field where a conductor exists. But if the magnet be at rest and the conductor be set in motion, no electric field is produced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, but an electromotive force which corresponds to no energy in itself is produced in the conductor; this causes an electric current of the same magnitude and the same career as the electric force, it being of course assumed that the relative motion in both of these cases is the same.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">2. Examples of a similar kind such as the unsuccessful attempt to substantiate the motion of the earth relative to the “Light-medium” lead us to the supposition that not only in mechanics, but also in electrodynamics, no properties of observed facts correspond to a concept of absolute rest; but that for all coordinate systems for which the mechanical equations hold, the equivalent electrodynamical and optical equations hold also, as has already been shown for magnitudes of the first order. In the following we make these assumptions (which we shall subsequently call the Principle of Relativity) and introduce the further assumption,—an assumption which is at the first sight quite irreconcilable with the former one—that light is propagated in vacant space, with a velocity <i>c</i> which is independent of the nature of motion of the emitting body. These two assumptions are quite sufficient to give us a simple and consistent theory of electrodynamics of moving bodies on the basis of the Maxwellian theory for bodies at rest. The introduction of a “Lightäther” will be proved to be superfluous, for according to the conceptions which will be developed, we shall introduce neither a space absolutely at rest, and endowed with special properties, nor shall we associate a velocity-vector with a point in which electro-magnetic processes take place.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">3. Like every other theory in electrodynamics, the theory is based on the kinematics of rigid bodies; in the enunciation of every theory, we have to do with relations between rigid bodies (co-ordinate system), clocks, and electromagnetic processes. An insufficient consideration of these circumstances is the cause of difficulties with which the electrodynamics of moving bodies have to fight at present.</p>\r\n",
      "<h3 class=\"c008\">I.—KINEMATICAL PORTION.</h3>\r\n",
      "<h4 class=\"c009\" id=\"sect2-1\">§ 1. Definition of Synchronism.</h4>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">Let us have a co-ordinate system, in which the Newtonian equations hold. For distinguishing this system from another which will be introduced hereafter, we shall always call it “the stationary system.”</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">If a material point be at rest in this system, then its position in this system can be found out by a measuring rod, and can be expressed by the methods of Euclidean Geometry, or in Cartesian co-ordinates.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, the values of its coordinates must be expressed as functions of time. It is always to be borne in mind that <i>such a mathematical definition has a physical sense, only when we have a clear notion of what is meant by time. We have to take into consideration the fact that those of our conceptions, in which time plays a part, are always conceptions of synchronism.</i> For example, we say that a train arrives here at 7 o’clock; this means that the exact pointing of the little hand of my watch to 7, and the arrival of the train are synchronous events.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">It may appear that all difficulties connected with the definition of time can be removed when in place of time, we substitute the position of the little hand of my watch. Such a definition is in fact sufficient, when it is required to define time exclusively for the place at which the clock is stationed. But the definition is not sufficient when it is required to connect by time events taking place at different stations,—or what amounts to the same thing,—to estimate by means of time (zeitlich werten) the occurrence of events, which take place at stations distant from the clock.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Now with regard to this attempt;—the time-estimation of events, we can satisfy ourselves in the following manner. Suppose an observer—who is stationed at the origin of coordinates with the clock—associates a ray of light which comes to him through space, and gives testimony to the event of which the time is to be estimated,—with the corresponding position of the hands of the clock. But such an association has this defect,—it depends on the position of the observer provided with the clock, as we know by experience. We can attain to a more practicable result by the following treatment.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">If an observer be stationed at A with a clock, he can estimate the time of events occurring in the immediate neighbourhood of A, by looking for the position of the hands of the clock, which are synchronous with the event. If an observer be stationed at B with a clock,—we should add that the clock is of the same nature as the one at A,—he can estimate the time of events occurring about B. But without further premises, it is not possible to compare, as far as time is concerned, the events at B with the events at A. We have hitherto an A-time, and a B-time, but no time common to A and B. This last time (<i>i.e.</i>, common time) can be defined, if we establish by definition that the time which light requires in travelling from A to B is equivalent to the time which light requires in travelling from B to A. For example, a ray of light proceeds from A at A-time t<sub>A</sub> towards B, arrives and is reflected from B at B-time t<sub>B</sub>, and returns to A at A-time t′<sub>A</sub>. According to the definition, both clocks are synchronous, if</p>\r\n",

      "</div>\r\n",
      "</div>\r\n",
      "</div>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c010\">We assume that this definition of synchronism is possible without involving any inconsistency, for any number of points, therefore the following relations hold:—</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">1. If the clock at B be synchronous with the clock at A, then the clock at A is synchronous with the clock at B.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">2. If the clock at A as well as the clock at B are both synchronous with the clock at C, then the clocks at A and B are synchronous.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Thus with the help of certain physical experiences, we have established what we understand when we speak of clocks at rest at different stations, and synchronous with one another; and thereby we have arrived at a definition of synchronism and time.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">In accordance with experience we shall assume that the magnitude</p>\r\n",

Suppose at two points A and B of the stationary system two clocks are given which are synchronous in the sense explained in § 3 when viewed from the stationary system. Suppose the clock at A to be set in motion in the line joining it with B, then after the arrival of the clock at B, they will no longer be found synchronous, but the clock which was set in motion from A will lag behind the clock which had been all along at B by an amount ½<i>t</i>(<i>v²</i>/<i>c²</i>), where <i>t</i> is the time required for the journey.</p>\r\n",

If at A, there be two synchronous clocks, and if we set in motion one of them with a constant velocity along a closed curve till it comes back to A, the journey being completed in <i>t</i>-seconds, then after arrival, the last mentioned clock will be behind the stationary one by ½<i>t</i>(<i>v²</i>/<i>c²</i>) seconds.

Let us have a point-mass of electricity which is of magnitude unity in the stationary system K, <i>i.e.</i>, it exerts a unit force upon a similar quantity placed at a distance of 1 cm. If this quantity of electricity be at rest in the stationary system, then the force acting upon it is equivalent to the vector (X, Y, Z) of electric force. But if the quantity of electricity be at rest relative to the moving system (at least for the moment considered), then the force acting upon it, and measured in the moving system is equivalent to the vector (X′, Y′, Z′). The first three of equations (<a href=\"#eqn-2-1\" class=\"pginternal\">1</a>), (<a href=\"#eqn-2-2\" class=\"pginternal\">2</a>), (<a href=\"#eqn-2-3\" class=\"pginternal\">3</a>), can be expressed in the following way:—</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">1. If a point-mass of electric unit pole moves in an electro-magnetic field, then besides the electric force, an electromotive force acts upon it, which, neglecting the numbers involving the second and higher powers of <i>v</i>/<i>c</i>, is equivalent to the vector-product of the velocity vector, and the magnetic force divided by the velocity of light (Old mode of expression).</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">2. If a point-mass of electric unit pole moves in an electro-magnetic field, then the force acting upon it is equivalent to the electric force existing at the position of the unit pole, which we obtain by the transformation of the field to a co-ordinate system which is at rest relative to the electric unit pole [New mode of expression].</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Similar theorems hold with reference to the magnetic force. We see that in the theory developed the electro-magnetic force plays the part of an auxiliary concept, which owes its introduction in theory to the circumstance that the electric and magnetic forces possess no existence independent of the nature of motion of the co-ordinate system.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">It is further clear that the asymmetry mentioned in the introduction which occurs when we treat of the current excited by the relative motion of a magnet and a conductor disappears. Also the question about the seat of electromagnetic energy is seen to be without any meaning.</p>\r\n",

Since the electron is only slowly accelerated, and in consequence, no energy is given out in the form of radiation, therefore the energy drawn from the electro-static field may be put equal to the energy W of motion.

      "[<i>A short biographical note.</i>]</h2>\r\n",
      "</div>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">The name of Prof. Albrecht Einstein has now spread far beyond the narrow pale of scientific investigators owing to the brilliant confirmation of his predicted deflection of light-rays by the gravitational field of the sun during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919. But to the serious student of science, he has been known from the beginning of the current century, and many dark problems in physics has been illuminated with the lustre of his genius, before, owing to the latest sensation just mentioned, he flashes out before public imagination as a scientific star of the first magnitude.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Einstein is a Swiss-German of Jewish extraction, and began his scientific career as a privat-dozent in the Swiss University of Zürich about the year 1902. Later on, he migrated to the German University of Prague in Bohemia as ausser-ordentliche (or associate) Professor. In 1914, through the exertions of Prof. M. Planck of the Berlin University, he was appointed a paid member of the Royal (now National) Prussian Academy of Sciences, on a salary of 18,000 marks per year. In this post, he has only to do and guide research work. Another distinguished occupant of the same post was Van’t Hoff, the eminent physical chemist.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">It is rather difficult to give a detailed, and consistent chronological account of his scientific activities,—they are so variegated, and cover such a wide field. The first work which gained him distinction was an investigation on Brownian Movement. An admirable account will be found in Perrin’s book ‘The Atoms.’ Starting from Boltzmann’s theorem connecting the entropy, and the probability of a state, he deduced a formula on the mean displacement of small particles (colloidal) suspended in a liquid. This formula gives us one of the best methods for finding out a very fundamental number in physics—namely—the number of molecules in one gm. molecule of gas (Avogadro’s number). The formula was shortly afterwards verified by Perrin, Prof. of Chemical Physics in the Sorbonne, Paris.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">To Einstein is also due the resuscitation of Planck’s quantum theory of energy-emission. This theory has not yet caught the popular imagination to the same extent as the new theory of Time, and Space, but it is none the less iconoclastic in its scope as far as classical concepts are concerned. It was known for a long time that the observed emission of light from a heated black body did not correspond to the formula which could be deduced from the older classical theories of continuous emission and propagation. In the year 1900, Prof. Planck of the Berlin University worked out a formula which was based on the bold assumption that energy was emitted and absorbed by the molecules in multiples of the quantity <i>h</i>ν, where <i>h</i> is a constant (which is universal like the constant of gravitation), and ν is the frequency of the light.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The conception was so radically different from all accepted theories that in spite of the great success of Planck’s radiation formula in explaining the observed facts of black-body radiation, it did not meet with much favour from the physicists. In fact, some one remarked jocularly that according to Planck, energy flies out of a radiator like a swarm of gnats.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">But Einstein found a support for the new-born concept in another direction. It was known that if green or ultraviolet light was allowed to fall on a plate of some alkali metal, the plate lost electrons. The electrons were emitted with all velocities, but there is generally a maximum limit. From the investigations of Lenard and Ladenburg, the curious discovery was made that this maximum velocity of emission did not at all depend upon the intensity of light, but upon its wavelength. The more violet was the light, the greater was the velocity of emission.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">To account for this fact, Einstein made the bold assumption that the light is propagated in space as a unit pulse (he calls it a Light-cell), and falling upon an individual atom, liberates electrons according to the energy equation</p>\r\n",

      "<p class=\"c005\">There was little material for the confirmation of this law when it was first proposed (1905), and eleven years elapsed before Prof. Millikan established, by a set of experiments scarcely rivalled for the ingenuity, skill, and care displayed, the absolute truth of the law. As results of this confirmation, and other brilliant triumphs, the quantum law is now regarded as a fundamental law of Energetics. In recent years, X-rays have been added to the domain of light, and in this direction also, Einstein’s photo-electric formula has proved to be one of the most fruitful conceptions in Physics.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The quantum law was next extended by Einstein to the problems of decrease of specific heat at low temperature, and here also his theory was confirmed in a brilliant manner.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We pass over his other contributions to the equation of state, to the problems of null-point energy, and photo-chemical reactions. The recent experimental works of Nernst and Warburg seem to indicate that through Einstein’s genius, we are probably for the first time having a satisfactory theory of photo-chemical action.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">In 1915, Einstein made an excursion into Experimental Physics, and here also, in his characteristic way, he tackled one of the most fundamental concepts of Physics. It is well-known that according to Ampere, the magnetisation of iron and iron-like bodies, when placed within a coil carrying an electric current is due to the excitation in the metal of small electrical circuits. But the conception though a very fruitful one, long remained without a trace of experimental proof, though after the discovery of the electron, it was generally believed that these molecular currents may be due to the rotational motion of free electrons within the metal. It is easily seen that if in the process of magnetisation, a number of electrons be set into rotatory motion, then these will impart to the metal itself a turning couple. The experiment is a rather difficult one, and many physicists tried in vain to observe the effect. But in collaboration with de Haas, Einstein planned and successfully carried out this experiment, and proved the essential correctness of Ampere’s views.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Einstein’s studies on Relativity were commenced in the year 1905, and has been continued up to the present time. The first paper in the present collection forms Einstein’s first great contribution to the Principle of Special Relativity. We have recounted in the introduction how out of the chaos and disorder into which the electrodynamics and optics of moving bodies had fallen previous to 1895, Lorentz, Einstein and Minkowski have succeeded in building up a consistent, and fruitful new theory of Time and Space.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">But Einstein was not satisfied with the study of the special problem of Relativity for uniform motion, but tried, in a series of papers beginning from 1911, to extend it to the case of non-uniform motion. The last paper in the present collection is a translation of a comprehensive article which he contributed to the Annalen der Physik in 1916 on this subject, and gives, in his own words, the Principles of Generalized Relativity. The triumphs of this theory are now matters of public knowledge.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Einstein is now only 45, and it is to be hoped that science will continue to be enriched, for a long time to come, with further achievements of his genius.</p>\r\n",

      "<h3 class=\"c008\">INTRODUCTION.</h3>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">At the present time, different opinions are being held about the fundamental equations of Electro-dynamics for moving bodies. The Hertzian<a id=\"r9\"></a><a href=\"#f9\" class=\"c007 pginternal\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> forms must be given up, for it has appeared that they are contrary to many experimental results.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">In 1895 H. A. Lorentz<a id=\"r10\"></a><a href=\"#f10\" class=\"c007 pginternal\"><sup>[10]</sup></a> published his theory of optical and electrical phenomena in moving bodies; this theory was based upon the atomistic conception (vorstellung) of electricity, and on account of its great success appears to have justified the bold hypotheses, by which it has been ushered into existence. In his theory, Lorentz proceeds from certain equations, which must hold at every point of “Äther”; then by forming the average values over “Physically infinitely small” regions, which however contain large numbers of electrons, the equations for electro-magnetic processes in moving bodies can be successfully built up.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">In particular, Lorentz’s theory gives a good account of the non-existence of relative motion of the earth and the luminiferous “Äther”; it shows that this fact is intimately connected with the covariance of the original equation, when certain simultaneous transformations of the space and time co-ordinates are effected; these transformations have therefore obtained from H. Poincare<a id=\"r11\"></a><a href=\"#f11\" class=\"c007 pginternal\"><sup>[11]</sup></a> the name of Lorentz-transformations. The covariance of these fundamental equations, when subjected to the Lorentz-transformation is a purely mathematical fact <i>i.e.</i> not based on any physical considerations; I will call this the Theorem of Relativity; this theorem rests essentially on the form of the differential equations for the propagation of waves with the velocity of light.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Now without <i>recognizing</i> any hypothesis about the connection between “Äther” and matter, we can expect these mathematically evident theorems to have their consequences so far extended—that thereby even those laws of ponderable media which are yet unknown may anyhow possess this covariance when subjected to a Lorentz-transformation; by saying this, we do not indeed express an opinion, but rather a conviction,—and this conviction I may be permitted to call the Postulate of Relativity. The position of affairs here is almost the same as when the Principle of Conservation of Energy was postulated in cases, where the corresponding forms of energy were unknown.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Now if hereafter, we succeed in maintaining this covariance as a definite connection between pure and simple observable phenomena in moving bodies, the definite connection may be styled ‘the Principle of Relativity.’</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">These differentiations seem to me to be necessary for enabling us to characterise the present day position of the electro-dynamics for moving bodies.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">H. A. Lorentz<a id=\"r12\"></a><a href=\"#f12\" class=\"c007 pginternal\"><sup>[12]</sup></a> has found out the “Relativity theorem” and has created the Relativity-postulate as a hypothesis that electrons and matter suffer contractions in consequence of their motion according to a certain law.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">A. Einstein<a id=\"r13\"></a><a href=\"#f13\" class=\"c007 pginternal\"><sup>[13]</sup></a> has brought out the point very clearly, that this postulate is not an artificial hypothesis but is rather a new way of comprehending the time-concept which is forced upon us by observation of natural phenomena.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The Principle of Relativity has not yet been formulated for electro-dynamics of moving bodies in the sense characterized by me. In the present essay, while formulating this principle, I shall obtain the fundamental equations for moving bodies in a sense which is uniquely determined by this principle.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">But it will be shown that none of the forms hitherto assumed for these equations can exactly fit in with this principle.<a id=\"r14\"></a><a href=\"#f14\" class=\"c007 pginternal\"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We would at first expect that the fundamental equations which are assumed by Lorentz for moving bodies would correspond to the Relativity Principle. But it will be shown that this is not the case for the general equations which Lorentz has for any possible, and also for magnetic bodies; but this is approximately the case (if neglect the square of the velocity of matter in comparison to the velocity of light) for those equations which Lorentz hereafter infers for non-magnetic bodies. But this latter accordance with the Relativity Principle is due to the fact that the condition of non-magnetisation has been formulated in a way not corresponding to the Relativity Principle; therefore the accordance is due to the fortuitous compensation of two contradictions to the Relativity-Postulate. But meanwhile enunciation of the Principle in a rigid manner does not signify any contradiction to the hypotheses of Lorentz’s molecular theory, but it shall become clear that the assumption of the contraction of the electron in Lorentz’s theory must be introduced at an earlier stage than Lorentz has actually done.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">In an appendix, I have gone into discussion of the position of Classical Mechanics with respect to the Relativity Postulate. Any easily perceivable modification of mechanics for satisfying the requirements of the Relativity theory would hardly afford any noticeable difference in observable processes; but would lead to very surprising consequences. By laying down the Relativity-Postulate from the outset, sufficient means have been created for deducing henceforth the complete series of Laws of Mechanics from the principle of conservation of Energy alone (the form of the Energy being given in explicit forms).</p>\r\n",
      "<h4 class=\"c009\">NOTATIONS.</h4>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">Let a rectangular system (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>,) of reference be given in space and time. The unit of time shall be chosen in such a manner with reference to the unit of length that the velocity of light in space becomes unity.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Although I would prefer not to change the notations used by Lorentz, it appears important to me to use a different selection of symbols, for thereby certain homogeneity will appear from the very beginning. I shall denote the vector electric force by E, the magnetic induction by M, the electric induction by <i>e</i> and the magnetic force by <i>m</i>, so that (E, M, <i>e</i>, <i>m</i>) are used instead of Lorentz’s (E, B, D, H) respectively.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">I shall further make use of complex magnitudes in a way which is not yet current in physical investigations, <i>i.e.</i>, instead of operating with (<i>t</i>), I shall operate with (<i>i t</i>), where <i>i</i> denotes √(-1). If now instead of (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>i t</i>), I use the method of writing with indices, certain essential circumstances will come into evidence; on this will be based a general use of the suffixes (1, 2, 3, 4). The advantage of this method will be, as I expressly emphasize here, that we shall have to handle symbols which have apparently a purely real appearance; we can however at any moment pass to real equations if it is understood that of the symbols with indices, such ones as have the suffix 4 only once, denote imaginary quantities, while those which have not at all the suffix 4, or have it twice denote real quantities.</p>\r\n",

      "<p class=\"c005\">Further let <i>u</i> denote the velocity vector of matter, ε the dielectric constant, μ the magnetic permeability, σ the conductivity of matter, while ρ denotes the density of electricity in space, and <i>x</i> the vector of “Electric Current” which we shall some across in <a href=\"#sect4-7\" class=\"pginternal\">§7</a> and <a href=\"#sect4-8\" class=\"pginternal\">§8</a>.</p>\r\n",

Let us now adhere to these simpler laws, whereby we require that for the limiting case ε = 1, μ = 1, σ = 0, they should constitute the laws for ponderable bodies. In this ideal limiting case ε = 1, μ = 1, σ = 0, E will be equal to <i>e</i>, and M to <i>m</i>.

      "<p class=\"c004\">In the statement of the fundamental equations, our leading idea had been that they should retain a covariance of form, when subjected to a group of Lorentz-transformations. Now we have to deal with ponderomotive reactions and energy in the electro-magnetic field. Here from the very first there can be no doubt that the settlement of this question is in some way connected with the simplest forms which can be given to the fundamental equations, satisfying the conditions of covariance. In order to arrive at such forms, I shall first of all put the fundamental equations in a typical form which brings out clearly their covariance in case of a Lorentz-transformation. Here I am using a method of calculation, which enables us to deal in a simple manner with the space-time vectors of the 1st, and 2nd kind, and of which the rules, as far as required are given below.</p>\r\n",

      "<p class=\"c004\">A Lecture delivered before the Naturforscher Versammlung (Congress of Natural Philosophers) at Cologne—(21st September, 1908).</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Gentlemen,</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The conceptions about time and space, which I hope to develop before you to-day, has grown on experimental physical grounds. Herein lies its strength. The tendency is radical. Henceforth, the old conception of space for itself, and time for itself shall reduce to a mere shadow, and some sort of union of the two will be found consistent with facts.</p>\r\n",
      "<h3 class=\"c008\">I</h3>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">Now I want to show you how we can arrive at the changed concepts about time and space from mechanics, as accepted now-a-days, from purely mathematical considerations. The equations of Newtonian mechanics show a twofold invariance, (<i>i</i>) their form remains unaltered when we subject the fundamental space-coordinate system to any possible change of position, (<i>ii</i>) when we change the system in its nature of motion, <i>i. e.</i>, when we impress upon it any uniform motion of translation, the null-point of time plays no part. We are accustomed to look upon the axioms of geometry as settled once for all, while we seldom have the same amount of conviction regarding the axioms of mechanics, and therefore the two invariants are seldom mentioned in the same breath. Each one of these denotes a certain group of transformations for the differential equations of mechanics. We look upon the existence of the first group as a fundamental characteristics of space. We always prefer to leave off the second group to itself, and with a light heart conclude that we can never decide from physical considerations whether the space, which is supposed to be at rest, may not finally be in uniform motion. So these two groups lead quite separate existences besides each other. Their totally heterogeneous character may scare us away from the attempt to compound them. Yet it is the whole compounded group which as a whole gives us occasion for thought.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We wish to picture to ourselves the whole relation graphically. Let (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) be the rectangular coordinates of space, and <i>t</i> denote the time. Subjects of our perception are always connected with place and time. <i>No one has observed a place except at a particular time, or has observed a time except at a particular place.</i> Yet I respect the dogma that time and space have independent existences. I will call a space-point plus a time-point, <i>i.e.</i>, a system of values <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>, as a <i>world-point</i>. The manifoldness of all possible values of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>, will be the <i>world</i>. I can draw four world-axes with the chalk. Now any axis drawn consists of quickly vibrating molecules, and besides, takes part in all the journeys of the earth ; and therefore gives us occasion for reflection. The greater abstraction required for the four-axes does not cause the mathematician any trouble. In order not to allow any yawning gap to exist, we shall suppose that at every place and time, something perceptible exists. In order not to specify either matter or electricity, we shall simply style these as substances. We direct our attention to the <i>world-point</i> <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>, and suppose that we are in a position to recognise this substantial point at any subsequent time. Let <i>dt</i> be the time element corresponding to the changes of space coordinates of this point [<i>dx</i>, <i>dy</i>, <i>dz</i>]. Then we obtain (as a picture, so to speak, of the perennial life-career of the substantial point),—a curve in the <i>world</i>—the <i>world-line</i>, the points on which unambiguously correspond to the parameter <i>t</i> from +∞ to -∞. The whole world appears to be resolved in such <i>world-lines</i>, and I may just deviate from my point if I say that according to my opinion the physical laws would find their fullest expression as mutual relations among these lines.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">By this conception of time and space, the (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) manifoldness <i>t</i> = 0 and its two sides <i>t</i> &lt; 0 and <i>t</i> &gt; 0 falls asunder. If for the sake of simplicity, we keep the null-point of time and space fixed, then the first named group of mechanics signifies that at <i>t</i> = 0 we can give the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>-axes any possible rotation about the null-point corresponding to the homogeneous linear transformation of the expression</p>\r\n",

      "</div>\r\n",
      "</div>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c010\">The second group denotes that without changing the expression for the mechanical laws, we can substitute (<i>x</i> - α<i>t</i>, <i>y</i> - β<i>t</i>, <i>z</i> - γ<i>t</i> for (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) where (α, β, γ) are any constants. According to this we can give the time-axis any possible direction in the upper half of the world <i>t</i> &gt; 0. Now what have the demands of orthogonality in space to do with this perfect freedom of the time-axis towards the upper half?</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">To establish this connection, let us take a positive parameter c, and let us consider the figure</p>\r\n",

      "</div>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c010\">According to the analogy of the hyperboloid of two sheets, this consists of two sheets separated by <i>t</i> = 0. Let us consider the sheet, in the region of <i>t</i> &gt; 0, and let us now conceive the transformation of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i> in the new system of variables; (<i>x’</i>, <i>y’</i>, <i>z’</i>, <i>t’</i>) by means of which the form of the expression will remain unaltered. Clearly the rotation of space round the null-point belongs to this group of transformations. Now we can have a full idea of the transformations which we picture to ourselves from a particular transformation in which (<i>y</i>, <i>z</i>) remain unaltered. Let us draw the cross section of the upper sheets with the plane of the <i>x</i>- and <i>t</i>-axes, <i>i.e.</i>, the upper half of the hyperbola <i>c²</i><i>t²</i> - x² = 1, with its asymptotes (<i>vide</i> fig. 1).</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Then let us draw the radius rector OA′, the tangent A′ B′ at A′, and let us complete the parallelogram OA′ B′ C′; also produce B′ C′ to meet the x-axis at D′. Let us now take Ox′, OA′ as new axes with the unit measuring rods OC′ = 1, OA′ = (1/c) ; then the hyperbola is again expressed in the form <i>c²</i><i>t′²</i> - x′² = 1, t′ &gt; 0 and the transition from (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>) to (<i>x′</i> <i>y′</i> <i>z′</i> <i>t</i>) is one of the transitions in question. Let us add to this characteristic transformation any possible displacement of the space and time null-points; then we get a group of transformation depending only on <i>c</i>, which we may denote by G<sub class=\"c8\">c</sub>.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Now let us increase <i>c</i> to infinity. Thus (1/c) becomes zero and it appears from the figure that the hyperbola is gradually shrunk into the <i>x</i>-axis, the asymptotic angle becomes a straight one, and every special transformation in the limit changes in such a manner that the <i>t</i>-axis can have any possible direction upwards, and <i>x′</i> more and more approximates to <i>x</i>. Remembering this point it is clear that the full group belonging to Newtonian Mechanics is simply the group G<sub class=\"c8\">c</sub>, with the value of <i>c</i> = ∞. In this state of affairs, and since G<sub class=\"c8\">c</sub> is mathematically more intelligible than G<sub>∞</sub>, a mathematician may, by a free play of imagination, hit upon the thought that natural phenomena possess an invariance not only for the group G<sub>∞</sub>, but in fact also for a group G<sub class=\"c8\">c</sub>, where <i>c</i> is finite, but yet exceedingly large compared to the usual measuring units. Such a preconception would be an extraordinary triumph for pure mathematics.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">At the same time I shall remark for which value of <i>c</i>, this invariance can be conclusively held to be true. <i>For c, we shall substitute the velocity of light c in free space.</i> In order to avoid speaking either of space or of vacuum, we may take this quantity as the ratio between the electrostatic and electro-magnetic units of electricity.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We can form an idea of the invariant character of the expression for natural laws for the group-transformation G<sub class=\"c8\">c</sub> in the following manner.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Out of the totality of natural phenomena, we can, by successive higher approximations, deduce a coordinate system (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>); by means of this coordinate system, we can represent the phenomena according to definite laws. This system of reference is by no means uniquely determined by the phenomena. <i>We can change the system of reference in any possible manner corresponding to the above-mentioned group transformation G<sub>c</sub>, but the expressions for natural laws will not be changed thereby.</i></p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">For example, corresponding to the above described figure, we can call <i>t′</i> the time, but then necessarily the space connected with it must be expressed by the manifoldness (<i>x′</i> <i>y</i> <i>z</i>). The physical laws are now expressed by means of <i>x′</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t′</i>,—and the expressions are just the same as in the case of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>. According to this, we shall have in the world, not one space, but many spaces,—quite analogous to the case that the three-dimensional space consists of an infinite number of planes. The three-dimensional geometry will be a chapter of four-dimensional physics. Now you perceive, why I said in the beginning that time and space shall reduce to mere shadows and we shall have a world complete in itself.</p>\r\n",
      "<h3 class=\"c008\">II</h3>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">Now the question may be asked,—what circumstances lead us to these changed views about time and space, are they not in contradiction with observed phenomena, do they finally guarantee us advantages for the description of natural phenomena?</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Before we enter into the discussion, a very important point must be noticed. Suppose we have individualised time and space in any manner; then a world-line parallel to the <i>t</i>-axis will correspond to a stationary point; a world-line inclined to the <i>t</i>-axis will correspond to a point moving uniformly; and a world-curve will correspond to a point moving in any manner. Let us now picture to our mind the world-line passing through any world point <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>; now if we find the world-line parallel to the radius vector OA′ of the hyperboloidal sheet, then we can introduce OA′ as a new time-axis, and then according to the new conceptions of time and space the substance will appear to be at rest in the world point concerned. We shall now introduce this fundamental axiom:—</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\"><i>The substance existing at any world point can always be conceived to be at rest, if we establish our time and space suitably.</i> The axiom denotes that in a world-point, the expression</p>\r\n",

If OA′ is parallel to the second strip, we can take <i>t′</i> as the <i>t</i>-axis and <i>x′</i> as the <i>x</i>-axis, then the second body will appear to be at rest, and the first body in uniform motion.

I will assume that two point-masses <i>m</i> and <i>m₁</i> describe their world-lines; a moving force-vector is exercised by <i>m</i> upon <i>m₁</i>, and the expression is just the same as in the case of the electron, only we have to write +<i>mm₁</i> instead -<i>ee₁</i>. We shall consider only the special case in which the acceleration-vector of <i>m</i> is always zero: then <i>t</i> may be introduced in such a manner that <i>m</i> may be regarded as fixed, the motion of <i>m</i> is now subjected to the moving-force vector of <i>m</i> alone. If we now modify this given vector by writing -([<sup>.</sup>]1/√(1-(<i>v</i>²/<i>c²</i>)) instead of [.<i>t</i>] ([.<i>t</i>] = 1 up to magnitudes of the order (1[<sup>.</sup>]/<i>c²</i>)), then it appears that Kepler’s laws hold good for the position (<i>x₁</i>, <i>y₁</i>, <i>z₁</i>), of <i>m₁</i> at any time, only in place of the time <i>t₁</i>, we have to write the proper time τ₁ of <i>m₁</i>.

The generalization of the Relativity theory has been made much easier through the form given to the special Relativity theory by Minkowski, which mathematician was the first to recognize clearly the formal equivalence of the space like and time-like co-ordinates, and who made use of it in the building up of the theory. The mathematical apparatus useful for the general relativity theory, lay already complete in the “Absolute Differential Calculus,” which were based on the researches of Gauss, Riemann and Christoffel on the non-Euclidean manifold, and which have been shaped into a system by Ricci and Levi-civita, and already applied to the problems of theoretical physics. I have in part B of this communication developed in the simplest and clearest manner, all the supposed mathematical auxiliaries, not known to Physicists, which will be useful for our purpose, so that, a study of the mathematical literature is not necessary for an understanding of this paper. Finally in this place I thank my friend Grossmann, by whose help I was not only spared the study of the mathematical literature pertinent to this subject, but who also aided me in the researches on the field equations of gravitation.</p>\r\n",

      "Principal considerations about the Postulate of Relativity.</h3>\r\n",
      "<h4 class=\"c009\">§ 1. Remarks on the Special Relativity Theory.</h4>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">The special relativity theory rests on the following postulate which also holds valid for the Galileo-Newtonian mechanics.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">If a co-ordinate system K be so chosen that when referred to it, the physical laws hold in their simplest forms these laws would be also valid when referred to another system of co-ordinates K′ which is subjected to an uniform translational motion relative to K. We call this postulate “The Special Relativity Principle.” By the word special, it is signified that the principle is limited to the case, when K′ has <i>uniform translatory</i> motion with reference to K, but the equivalence of K and K′ does not extend to the case of non-uniform motion of K′ relative to K.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The Special Relativity Theory does not differ from the classical mechanics through the assumption of this postulate, but only through the postulate of the constancy of light-velocity in vacuum which, when combined with the special relativity postulate, gives in a well-known way, the relativity of synchronism as well as the Lorenz-transformation, with all the relations between moving rigid bodies and clocks.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The modification which the theory of space and time has undergone through the special relativity theory, is indeed a profound one, but a weightier point remains untouched. According to the special relativity theory, the theorems of geometry are to be looked upon as the laws about any possible relative positions of solid bodies at rest, and more generally the theorems of kinematics, as theorems which describe the relation between measurable bodies and clocks. Consider two material points of a solid body at rest; then according to these conceptions there corresponds to these points a wholly definite extent of length, independent of kind, position, orientation and time of the body.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Similarly let us consider two positions of the pointers of a clock which is at rest with reference to a co-ordinate system; then to these positions, there always corresponds, a time-interval of a definite length, independent of time and place. It would be soon shown that the general relativity theory can not hold fast to this simple physical significance of space and time.</p>\r\n",
      "<h4 class=\"c009\">§ 2. About the reasons which explain the extension of the relativity-postulate.</h4>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">To the classical mechanics (no less than) to the special relativity theory, is attached an episteomological defect, which was perhaps first cleanly pointed out by E. Mach. We shall illustrate it by the following example; Let two fluid bodies of equal kind and magnitude swim freely in space at such a great distance from one another (and from all other masses) that only that sort of gravitational forces are to be taken into account which the parts of any of these bodies exert upon each other. The distance of the bodies from one another is invariable. The relative motion of the different parts of each body is not to occur. But each mass is seen to rotate by an observer at rest relative to the other mass round the connecting line of the masses with a constant angular velocity (definite relative motion for both the masses). Now let us think that the surfaces of both the bodies (S₁ and S₂) are measured with the help of measuring rods (relatively at rest); it is then found that the surface of S₁ is a sphere and the surface of the other is an ellipsoid of rotation. We now ask, why is this difference between the two bodies? An answer to this question can only then be regarded as satisfactory from the episteomological standpoint when the thing adduced as the cause is an observable fact of experience. The law of causality has the sense of a definite statement about the world of experience only when observable facts alone appear as causes and effects.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The Newtonian mechanics does not give to this question any satisfactory answer. For example, it says:—The laws of mechanics hold true for a space R₁ relative to which the body S₁ is at rest, not however for a space relative to which S₂ is at rest.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The Galiliean space, which is here introduced is however only a purely imaginary cause, not an observable thing. It is thus clear that the Newtonian mechanics does not, in the case treated here, actually fulfil the requirements of causality, but produces on the mind a fictitious complacency, in that it makes responsible a <i>wholly imaginary cause</i> R₁ for the different behaviours of the bodies S₁ and S₂ which are actually observable.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">A satisfactory explanation to the question put forward above can only be thus given:—that the physical system composed of S₁ and S₂ shows for itself alone no conceivable cause to which the different behaviour of S₁ and S₂ can be attributed. The cause must thus lie outside the system. We are therefore led to the conception that the general laws of motion which determine specially the forms of S₁ and S₂ must be of such a kind, that the mechanical behaviour of S₁ and S₂ must be essentially conditioned by the distant masses, which we had not brought into the system considered. These distant masses, (and their relative motion as regards the bodies under consideration) are then to be looked upon as the seat of the principal observable causes for the different behaviours of the bodies under consideration. They take the place of the imaginary cause R₁. Among all the conceivable spaces R₁ and R₂ moving in any manner relative to one another, there is a priori, no one set which can be regarded as affording greater advantages, against which the objection which was already raised from the standpoint of the theory of knowledge cannot be again revived. The laws of physics must be so constituted that they should remain valid for any system of co-ordinates moving in any manner. We thus arrive at an extension of the relativity postulate.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Besides this momentous episteomological argument, there is also a well-known physical fact which speaks in favour of an extension of the relativity theory. Let there be a Galiliean co-ordinate system K relative to which (at least in the four-dimensional region considered) a mass at a sufficient distance from other masses move uniformly in a line. Let K′ be a second co-ordinate system which has a uniformly accelerated motion relative to K. Relative to K′ any mass at a sufficiently great distance experiences an accelerated motion such that its acceleration and the direction of acceleration is independent of its material composition and its physical conditions.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Can any observer, at rest relative to K′, then conclude that he is in an actually accelerated reference-system? This is to be answered in the negative; the above-named behaviour of the freely moving masses relative to K′ can be explained in as good a manner in the following way. The reference-system K′ has no acceleration. In the space-time region considered there is a gravitation-field which generates the accelerated motion relative to K′.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">This conception is feasible, because to us the experience of the existence of a field of force (namely the gravitation field) has shown that it possesses the remarkable property of imparting the same acceleration to all bodies. The mechanical behaviour of the bodies relative to K′ is the same as experience would expect of them with reference to systems which we assume from habit as stationary; thus it explains why from the physical stand-point it can be assumed that the systems K and K′ can both with the same legitimacy be taken as at rest, that is, they will be equivalent as systems of reference for a description of physical phenomena.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">From these discussions we see, that the working out of the general relativity theory must, at the same time, lead to a theory of gravitation; for we can “create” a gravitational field by a simple variation of the co-ordinate system. Also we see immediately that the principle of the constancy of light-velocity must be modified, for we recognise easily that the path of a ray of light with reference to K′ must be, in general, curved, when light travels with a definite and constant velocity in a straight line with reference to K.</p>\r\n",
      "<h4 class=\"c009\">§ 3. The time-space continuum. Requirements of the general Co-variance for the equations expressing the laws of Nature in general.</h4>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">In the classical mechanics as well as in the special relativity theory, the co-ordinates of time and space have an immediate physical significance; when we say that any arbitrary point has <i>x₁</i> as its X₁ co-ordinate, it signifies that the projection of the point-event on the X₁-axis <i>ascertained</i> by means of a solid rod according to the rules of Euclidean Geometry is reached when a definite measuring rod, the unit rod, can be carried <i>x₁</i> times from the origin of co-ordinates along the X₁ axis. A point having <i>x₄</i> = <i>t₁</i> as the X₄ co-ordinate signifies that a unit clock which is adjusted to be at rest relative to the system of co-ordinates, and coinciding in its spatial position with the point-event and set according to some definite standard has gone over <i>x₄</i> = <i>t</i> periods before the occurrence of the point-event.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">This conception of time and space is continually present in the mind of the physicist, though often in an unconscious way, as is clearly recognised from the role which this conception has played in physical measurements. This conception must also appear to the reader to be lying at the basis of the second consideration of the last paragraph and imparting a sense to these conceptions. But we wish to show that we are to abandon it and in general to replace it by more general conceptions in order to be able to work out thoroughly the postulate of general relativity,—the case of special relativity appearing as a limiting case when there is no gravitation.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We introduce in a space, which is free from Gravitation-field, a Galiliean Co-ordinate System K (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>t</i>) and also, another system K′ (<i>x′</i> <i>y′</i> <i>z′</i> <i>t′</i>) rotating uniformly relative to K. The origin of both the systems as well as their <i>z</i>-axes might continue to coincide. We will show that for a space-time measurement in the system K′, the above established rules for the physical significance of time and space can not be maintained. On grounds of symmetry it is clear that a circle round the origin in the XY plane of K, can also be looked upon as a circle in the plane (X′, Y′) of K′. Let us now think of measuring the circumference and the diameter of these circles, with a unit measuring rod (infinitely small compared with the radius) and take the quotient of both the results of measurement. If this experiment be carried out with a measuring rod at rest relatively to the Galiliean system K we would get π, as the quotient. The result of measurement with a rod relatively at rest as regards K′ would be a number which is greater than π. This can be seen easily when we regard the whole measurement-process from the system K and remember that the rod placed on the periphery suffers a Lorenz-contraction, not however when the rod is placed along the radius. Euclidean Geometry therefore does not hold for the system K′; the above fixed conceptions of co-ordinates which assume the validity of Euclidean Geometry fail with regard to the system K′. We cannot similarly introduce in K′ a time corresponding to physical requirements, which will be shown by all similarly prepared clocks at rest relative to the system K′. In order to see this we suppose that two similarly made clocks are arranged one at the centre and one at the periphery of the circle, and considered from the stationary system K. According to the well-known results of the special relativity theory it follows—(as viewed from K)—that the clock placed at the periphery will go slower than the second one which is at rest. The observer at the common origin of co-ordinates who is able to see the clock at the periphery by means of light will see the clock at the periphery going slower than the clock beside him. Since he cannot allow the velocity of light to depend explicitly upon the time in the way under consideration he will interpret his observation by saying that the clock on the periphery actually goes slower than the clock at the origin. He cannot therefore do otherwise than define time in such a way that the rate of going of a clock depends on its position.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">We therefore arrive at this result. In the general relativity theory time and space magnitudes cannot be so defined that the difference in spatial co-ordinates can be immediately measured by the unit-measuring rod, and time-like co-ordinate difference with the aid of a normal clock.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The means hitherto at our disposal, for placing our co-ordinate system in the time-space continuum, in a definite way, therefore completely fail and it appears that there is no other way which will enable us to fit the co-ordinate system to the four-dimensional world in such a way, that by it we can expect to get a specially simple formulation of the laws of Nature. So that nothing remains for us but to regard all conceivable co-ordinate systems as equally suitable for the description of natural phenomena. This amounts to the following law:—</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\"><i>That in general, Laws of Nature are expressed by means of equations which are valid for all co-ordinate systems, that is, which are covariant for all possible transformations.</i> It is clear that a physics which satisfies this postulate will be unobjectionable from the standpoint of the general relativity postulate. Because among all substitutions there are, in every case, contained those, which correspond to all relative motions of the co-ordinate system (in three dimensions). This condition of general covariance which takes away the last remnants of physical objectivity from space and time, is a natural requirement, as seen from the following considerations. All our <i>well-substantiated</i> space-time propositions amount to the determination of space-time coincidences. If, for example, the event consisted in the motion of material points, then, for this last case, nothing else are really observable except the encounters between two or more of these material points. The results of our measurements are nothing else than well-proved theorems about such coincidences of material points, of our measuring rods with other material points, coincidences between the hands of a clock, dial-marks and point-events occurring at the same position and at the same time.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The introduction of a system of co-ordinates serves no other purpose than an easy description of totality of such coincidences. We fit to the world our space-time variables (<i>x₁</i> <i>x₂</i> <i>x₃</i> <i>x₄</i>) such that to any and every point-event corresponds a system of values of (<i>x₁</i> <i>x₂</i> <i>x₃</i> <i>x₄</i>). Two coincident point-events correspond to the same value of the variables (<i>x₁</i> <i>x₂</i> <i>x₃</i> <i>x₄</i>); <i>i.e.</i>, the coincidence is characterised by the equality of the co-ordinates. If we now introduce any four functions (<i>x′₁</i> <i>x′₂</i> <i>x′₃</i> <i>x′₄</i>) as co-ordinates, so that there is an unique correspondence between them, the equality of all the four co-ordinates in the new system will still be the expression of the space-time coincidence of two material points. As the purpose of all physical laws is to allow us to remember such coincidences, there is a priori no reason present, to prefer a certain co-ordinate system to another; <i>i.e.</i>, we get the condition of general covariance.</p>\r\n",

We assume firstly, that in a certain four-dimensional region considered, the special relativity theory is true for some particular choice of co-ordinates. The <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub>’s then have the values given in (4). A free material point moves with reference to such a system uniformly in a straight-line. If we now introduce, by any substitution, the space-time co-ordinates <i>x₁</i>...<i>x₄</i> then in the new system <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s are no longer constants, but functions of space and time. At the same time, the motion of a free point-mass in the new co-ordinates, will appear as curvilinear, and not uniform, in which the law of motion, will be <i>independent of the nature of the moving mass-points</i>. We can thus signify this motion as one under the influence of a gravitation field. We see that the appearance of a gravitation-field is connected with space-time variability of <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub>’s. In the general case, we can not by any suitable choice of axes, make special relativity theory valid throughout any finite region. We thus deduce the conception that <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub>’s describe the gravitational field. According to the general relativity theory, gravitation thus plays an exceptional rôle as distinguished from the others, specially the electromagnetic forces, in as much as the 10 functions <i>g</i><sub>στ</sub> representing gravitation, define immediately the metrical properties of the four-dimensional region.</p>\r\n",

      "Mathematical Auxiliaries for Establishing the General Covariant Equations.</h3>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">We have seen before that the general relativity-postulate leads to the condition that the system of equations for Physics, must be co-variants for any possible substitution of co-ordinates <i>x₁</i>, ... <i>x₄</i>; we have now to see how such general co-variant equations can be obtained. We shall now turn our attention to these purely mathematical propositions.

      "<p class=\"c005\">The fundamental idea of the general co-variant theory is this:—With reference to any co-ordinate system, let certain things (tensors) be defined by a number of functions of co-ordinates which are called the components of the tensor. There are now certain rules according to which the components can be calculated in a new system of co-ordinates, when these are known for the original system, and when the transformation connecting the two systems is known. The things herefrom designated as “Tensors” have further the property that the transformation equation of their components are linear and homogeneous; so that all the components in the new system vanish if they are all zero in the original system. Thus a law of Nature can be formulated by putting all the components of a tensor equal to zero so that it is a general co-variant equation; thus while we seek the laws of formation of the tensors, we also reach the means of establishing general co-variant laws.</p>\r\n",

If B<sup>μ</sup> and C<sup>ν</sup> are any two vectors, and if for every choice of them the inner product A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>μ</sup> C<sup>ν</sup> is a scalar, then A<sub>μν</sub> is a co-variant tensor. The last law holds even when there is the more special formulation, that with any arbitrary choice of the four-vector B<sup>μ</sup> alone the scalar product A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>μ</sup> B<sup>ν</sup> is a scalar, in which case we have the additional condition that A<sub>μν</sub> satisfies the symmetry condition. According to the method given above, we prove the tensor character of (A<sub>μν</sub> + A<sub>νμ</sub>), from which on account of symmetry follows the tensor-character of A<sub>μν</sub>.

If for example, C<sup>μ</sup> is any four-vector, then owing to the tensor character of A<sub>μν</sub> B<sup>ν</sup>, the inner product A<sub>μν</sub> C<sup>μ</sup> B<sup>ν</sup> is a scalar, both the four-vectors C<sup>μ</sup> and B<sup>ν</sup> being arbitrarily chosen.

      "<p class=\"c005\">The mathematical significance of this tensor is as follows; when the continuum is so shaped, that there is a co-ordinate system for which <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub><i>’s</i> are constants, B<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μστ</sub> all vanish.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">If we choose instead of the original co-ordinate system any new one, so would the <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s referred to this last system be no longer constants. The tensor character of B<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μστ</sub> shows us, however, that these components vanish collectively also in any other chosen system of reference. The vanishing of the Riemann Tensor is thus a necessary condition that for some choice of the axis-system <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s can be taken as constants. In our problem it corresponds to the case when by a suitable choice of the co-ordinate system, the special relativity theory holds throughout any finite region. By the reduction of (43) with reference to indices to τ and ρ, we get the covariant tensor of the second rank</p>\r\n",

A glance at the equations got in the last two paragraphs shows that, through such a choice, the law of formation of the tensors suffers a significant simplification. It is specially true for the tensor B<sub>μν</sub>, which plays a fundamental rôle in the theory. By this simplification, S<sub>μν</sub> vanishes of itself so that tensor B<sub>μν</sub> reduces to R<sub>μν</sub>.</p>\r\n",

      "<p class=\"c005\">Let us discuss this motion from the stand-point of any arbitrary co-ordinate-system K₁; it moves with reference to K₁ (as explained in §2) in a gravitational field. The laws of motion with reference to K₁ follow easily from the following consideration. With reference to K₀, the law of motion is a four-dimensional straight line and thus a geodesic. As a geodetic-line is defined independently of the system of co-ordinates, it would also be the law of motion for the motion of the material-point with reference to K₁. If we put</p>\r\n",

      "<p class=\"c005\">We now make the very simple assumption that this general covariant system of equations defines also the motion of the point in the gravitational field, when there exists no reference-system K₀, with reference to which the special relativity theory holds throughout a finite region. The assumption seems to us to be all the more legitimate, as (46) contains only the first differentials of <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>, among which there is no relation in the special case when K₀ exists.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">If γ<sub>μν</sub><sup>τ</sup>’s vanish, the point moves uniformly and in a straight line; these magnitudes therefore determine the deviation from uniformity. They are the components of the gravitational field.</p>\r\n",
      "<h4 class=\"c009\">§14. The Field-equation of Gravitation in the absence of matter.</h4>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c004\">In the following, we differentiate gravitation-field from matter in the sense that everything besides the gravitation-field will be signified as matter; therefore the term includes not only matter in the usual sense, but also the electro-dynamic field. Our next problem is to seek the field-equations of gravitation in the absence of matter. For this we apply the same method as employed in the foregoing paragraph for the deduction of the equations of motion for material points. A special case in which the field-equations sought-for are evidently satisfied is that of the special relativity theory in which <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s have certain constant values. This would be the case in a certain finite region with reference to a definite co-ordinate system K₀. With reference to this system, all the components B<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μστ</sub> of the Riemann’s Tensor [equation 43] vanish. These vanish then also in the region considered, with reference to every other co-ordinate system.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The equations of the gravitation-field free from matter must thus be in every case satisfied when all B<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μστ</sub> vanish. But this condition is clearly one which goes too far. For it is clear that the gravitation-field generated by a material point in its own neighbourhood can never be transformed <i>away</i> by any choice of axes, <i>i.e.</i>, it cannot be transformed to a case of constant <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Therefore it is clear that, for a gravitational field free from matter, it is desirable that the symmetrical tensors B<sub>μν</sub> deduced from the tensors B<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μστ</sub> should vanish. We thus get 10 equations for 10 quantities <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub> which are fulfilled in the special case when B<sup>ρ</sup><sub>μστ</sub>’s all vanish.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Remembering (44) we see that in absence of matter the field-equations come out as follows; (when referred to the special co-ordinate-system chosen.)</p>\r\n",

      "</div>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">It can also be shown that the choice of these equations is connected with a minimum of arbitrariness. For besides B<sub>μν</sub>, there is no tensor of the second rank, which can be built out of <i>g</i><sub>μν</sub>’s and their derivatives no higher than the second, and which is also linear in them.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">It will be shown that the equations arising in a purely mathematical way out of the conditions of the general relativity, together with equations (46), give us the Newtonian law of attraction as a first approximation, and lead in the second approximation to the explanation of the perihelion-motion of mercury discovered by Leverrier (the residual effect which could not be accounted for by the consideration of all sorts of disturbing factors).

Thus the electromagnetic laws of Maxwell and Lorentz <i>can be definitely proved</i> “to be independent of the manner in which they are referred to two coordinate systems which have a uniform translatory motion relative to each other.” (See “Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” page 5.) Thus so far as the electromagnetic laws are concerned, the principle of relativity <i>can be proved to be true</i>.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">But it is not known whether this principle will remain true in the case of other physical laws. We can always proceed on the assumption that it does remain true. Thus it is always possible to construct physical laws in such a way that they retain their form when referred to moving coordinates. The ultimate ground for formulating physical laws in this way is merely a subjective conviction that the principle of relativity is universally true. There is no <i>a priori</i> logical necessity that it should be so. Hence the Principle of Relativity (so far as it is applied to phenomena other than electromagnetic) must be regarded as a <i>postulate</i>, which we have assumed to be true, but for which we cannot adduce any definite proof, until after the generalisation is made and its consequences tested in the light of actual experience.</p>\r\n",

      "<p class=\"c005\">One of the two fundamental Postulates of the Principle of Relativity is that the velocity of light should remain constant whether the source is moving or stationary. It follows that even if a radiant source S move with a velocity <i>u</i>, it should always remain the centre of spherical waves expanding outwards with velocity <i>c</i>.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">At first sight, it may not appear clear why the velocity should remain constant. Indeed according to the theory of Ritz, the velocity should become <i>c</i> + <i>u</i>, when the source of light moves towards the observer with the velocity <i>u</i>.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">Prof. de Sitter has given an astronomical argument for deciding between these two divergent views. Let us suppose there is a double star of which one is revolving about the common centre of gravity in a circular orbit. Let the observer be in the plane of the orbit, at a great distance Δ.</p>\r\n",

      "<p class=\"c005\">The light emitted by the star when at the position A will be received by the observer after a time, Δ/(<i>c</i> + <i>u</i>) while the light emitted by the star when at the position B will be received after a time Δ/(<i>c</i> - <i>u</i>). Let T be the real half-period of the star. Then the observed half-period from B to A is approximately T - 2Δ<i>u</i>/<i>c²</i> and from A to B is T + 2Δ<i>u</i>/<i>c²</i>. Now if 2<i>u</i>Δ/<i>c²</i> be comparable to T, then it is impossible that the observations should satisfy Kepler’s Law. In most of the spectroscopic binary stars, 2<i>u</i>Δ/<i>c²</i> are not only of the same order as T, but are mostly much larger.

Instead of Minkowski’s space-time vector of the first kind, he uses the more expressive term ‘four-vector,’ thereby making it quite clear that it represents a directed quantity like a straight line, a force or a momentum, and has got 4 components, three in the direction of space-axes, and one in the direction of the time-axis.</p>\r\n",
      "<p class=\"c005\">The representation of the plane (defined by two straight lines) is much more difficult. In three dimensions, the plane can be represented by the vector perpendicular to itself. But that artifice is not available in four dimensions. For the perpendicular to a plane, we now have not a single line, but an infinite number of lines constituting a plane. This difficulty has been overcome by Minkowski in a very elegant manner which will become clear later on. Meanwhile we offer the following extract from the above mentioned work of Sommerfeld.</p>\r\n",

For two pieces of 3-space volumes can always be added together by the vectorial addition of their components.

      "<div class=\"c2\">Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c2\">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c12\">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c2\">The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c2\">The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c12\">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c2\">Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c2\">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/\">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c2\">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c2\">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c2\">Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c12\">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c2\">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c2\">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</div>\r\n",
      "<div class=\"c2\">Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org\">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</div>\r\n",

      "HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Kelvin writing in 1893, in his preface to the English edition of Hertz’s Researches on Electric Waves, says “many workers and many thinkers have helped to build up the nineteenth century school of plenum, one ether for light, heat, electricity, magnetism; and the German and English volumes containing Hertz’s electrical papers, given to the world in the last decade of the century, will be a permanent monument of the splendid consummation now realised.”\n",
      "Ten years later, in 1905, we find Einstein declaring that “the ether will be proved to be superfluous.” At first sight the revolution in scientific thought brought about in the course of a single decade appears to be almost too violent. A more careful even though a rapid review of the subject will, however, show how the Theory of Relativity gradually became a historical necessity.\n",
      "Towards the beginning of the nineteenth century, the luminiferous ether came into prominence as a result of the brilliant successes of the wave theory in the hands of Young and Fresnel. In its stationary aspect the elastic solid ether was the outcome of the search for a medium in which the light waves may “undulate.” This stationary ether, as shown by Young, also afforded a satisfactory explanation of astronomical aberration. But its very success gave rise to a host of new questions all bearing on the central problem of relative motion of ether and matter.\n",
      "Arago’s prism experiment.—The refractive index of a glass prism depends on the incident velocity of light outside the prism and its velocity inside the prism after refraction. On Fresnel’s fixed ether hypothesis, the incident light waves are situated in the stationary ether outside the prism and move with velocity c with respect to the ether. If the prism moves with a velocity u with respect to this fixed ether, then the incident velocity of light with respect to the prism should be c + u. Thus the refractive index of the glass prism should depend on u the absolute velocity of the prism, i.e., its velocity with respect to the fixed ether. Arago performed the experiment in 1819, but failed to detect the expected change.\n",
      "Airy-Boscovitch water-telescope experiment.—Boscovitch had still earlier in 1766, raised the very important question of the dependence of aberration on the refractive index of the medium filling the telescope. Aberration depends on the difference in the velocity of light outside the telescope and its velocity inside the telescope. If the latter velocity changes owing to a change in the medium filling the telescope, aberration itself should change, that is, aberration should depend on the nature of the medium.\n",
      "Airy, in 1871 filled up a telescope with water—but failed to detect any change in the aberration. Thus we get both in the case of Arago prism experiment and Airy-Boscovitch water-telescope experiment, the very startling result that optical effects in a moving medium seem to be quite independent of the velocity of the medium with respect to Fresnel’s stationary ether.\n",
      "Fresnel’s convection coefficient k = 1 - 1/μ2.—Possibly some form of compensation is taking place. Working on this hypothesis, Fresnel offered his famous ether convection theory. According to Fresnel, the presence of matter implies a definite condensation of ether within the region occupied by matter. This “condensed” or excess portion of ether is supposed to be carried away with its own piece of moving matter. It should be observed that only the “excess” portion is carried away, while the rest remains as stagnant as ever. A complete convection of the “excess” ether ρ′ with the full velocity u is optically equivalent to a partial convection of the total ether ρ, with only a fraction of the velocity k. u. Fresnel showed that if this convection coefficient k is 1 - 1/μ2 (μ being the refractive index of the prism), then the velocity of light after refraction within the moving prism would be altered to just such extent as would make the refractive index of the moving prism quite independent of its “absolute” velocity u. The non-dependence of aberration on the “absolute” velocity u, is also very easily explained with the help of this Fresnelian convection-coefficient k.\n",
      "Stokes’ viscous ether.—It should be remembered, however, that Fresnel’s stationary ether is absolutely fixed and is not at all disturbed by the motion of matter through it. In this respect Fresnelian ether cannot be said to behave in any respectable physical fashion, and this led Stokes, in 1845-46, to construct a more material type of medium. Stokes assumed that viscous motion ensues near the surface of separation of ether and moving matter, while at sufficiently distant regions the ether remains wholly undisturbed. He showed how such a viscous ether would explain aberration if all motion in it were differentially irrotational. But in order to explain the null Arago effect, Stokes was compelled to assume the convection hypothesis of Fresnel with an identical numerical value for k, namely 1 - 1/μ2. Thus the prestige of the Fresnelian convection-coefficient was enhanced, if anything, by the theoretical investigations of Stokes.\n",
      "Fizeau’s experiment.—Soon after, in 1851, it received direct experimental confirmation in a brilliant piece of work by Fizeau.\n",
      "If a divided beam of light is re-united after passing through two adjacent cylinders filled with water, ordinary interference fringes will be produced. If the water in one of the cylinders is now made to flow, the “condensed” ether within the flowing water would be convected and would produce a shift in the interference fringes. The shift actually observed agreed very well with a value of k = 1 - 1/μ2. The Fresnelian convection-coefficient now became firmly established as a consequence of a direct positive effect. On the other hand, the negative evidences in favour of the convection-coefficient had also multiplied. Mascart, Hoek, Maxwell and others sought for definite changes in different optical effects induced by the motion of the earth relative to the stationary ether. But all such attempts failed to reveal the slightest trace of any optical disturbance due to the “absolute” velocity of the earth, thus proving conclusively that all the different optical effects shared in the general compensation arising out of the Fresnelian convection of the excess ether. It must be carefully noted that the Fresnelian convection-coefficient implicitly assumes the existence of a fixed ether (Fresnel) or at least a wholly stagnant medium at sufficiently distant regions (Stokes), with reference to which alone a convection velocity can have any significance. Thus the convection-coefficient implying some type of a stationary or viscous, yet nevertheless “absolute” ether, succeeded in explaining satisfactorily all known optical facts down to 1880.\n",
      "Michelson-Morley Experiment.—In 1881, Michelson and Morley performed their classical experiments which undermined the whole structure of the old ether theory and thus served to introduce the new theory of relativity. The fundamental idea underlying this experiment is quite simple. In all old experiments the velocity of light situated in free ether was compared with the velocity of waves actually situated in a piece of moving matter and presumably carried away by it. The compensatory effect of the Fresnelian convection of ether afforded a satisfactory explanation of all negative results.\n",
      "In the Michelson-Morley experiment the arrangement is quite different. If there is a definite gap in a rigid body, light waves situated in free ether will take a definite time in crossing the gap. If the rigid platform carrying the gap is set in motion with respect to the ether in the direction of light propagation, light waves (which are even now situated in free ether) should presumably take a longer time to cross the gap.\n",
      "We cannot do better than quote Eddington’s description of this famous experiment. “The principle of the experiment may be illustrated by considering a swimmer in a river. It is easily realized that it takes longer to swim to a point 50 yards up-stream and back than to a point 50 yards across-stream and back. If the earth is moving through the ether there is a river of ether flowing through the laboratory, and a wave of light may be compared to a swimmer travelling with constant velocity relative to the current. If, then, we divide a beam of light into two parts, and send one-half swimming up the stream for a certain distance and then (by a mirror) back to the starting point, and send the other half an equal distance across stream and back, the across-stream beam should arrive back first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let the ether be flowing relative to the apparatus with velocity u in the direction Ox, and let OA, OB, be the two arms of the apparatus of equal length l, OA being placed up-stream. Let c be the velocity of light. The time for the double journey along OA and back is\n",
      "\n",
      "where\n",
      "\n",
      "a factor greater than unity.\n",
      "For the transverse journey the light must have a component velocity n up-stream (relative to the ether) in order to avoid being carried below OB: and since its total velocity is c, its component across-stream must be √(c² - u²), the time for the double journey OB is accordingly\n",
      "\n",
      "so that t₁ > t₂.\n",
      "But when the experiment was tried, it was found that both parts of the beam took the same time, as tested by the interference bands produced.”\n",
      "After a most careful series of observations, Michelson and Morley failed to detect the slightest trace of any effect due to earth’s motion through ether.\n",
      "The Michelson-Morley experiment seems to show that there is no relative motion of ether and matter. Fresnel’s stagnant ether requires a relative velocity of—u. Thus Michelson and Morley themselves thought at first that their experiment confirmed Stokes’ viscous ether, in which no relative motion can ensue on account of the absence of slipping of ether at the surface of separation. But even on Stokes’ theory this viscous flow of ether would fall off at a very rapid rate as we recede from the surface of separation. Michelson and Morley repeated their experiment at different heights from the surface of the earth, but invariably obtained the same negative results, thus failing to confirm Stokes’ theory of viscous flow.\n",
      "Lodge’s experiment.—Further, in 1893, Lodge performed his rotating sphere experiment which showed complete absence of any viscous flow of ether due to moving masses of matter. A divided beam of light, after repeated reflections within a very narrow gap between two massive hemispheres, was allowed to re-unite and thus produce interference bands. When the two hemispheres are set rotating, it is conceivable that the ether in the gap would be disturbed due to viscous flow, and any such flow would be immediately detected by a disturbance of the interference bands. But actual observation failed to detect the slightest disturbance of the ether in the gap, due to the motion of the hemispheres. Lodge’s experiment thus seems to show a complete absence of any viscous flow of ether.\n",
      "Apart from these experimental discrepancies, grave theoretical objections were urged against a viscous ether. Stokes himself had shown that his ether must be incompressible and all motion in it differentially irrotational, at the same time there should be absolutely no slipping at the surface of separation. Now all these conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied for any conceivable material medium without certain very special and arbitrary assumptions. Thus Stokes’ ether failed to satisfy the very motive which had led Stokes to formulate it, namely, the desirability of constructing a “physical” medium. Planck offered modified forms of Stokes’ theory which seemed capable of being reconciled with the Michelson-Morley experiment, but required very special assumptions. The very complexity and the very arbitrariness of these assumptions prevented Planck’s ether from attaining any degree of practical importance in the further development of the subject.\n",
      "The sole criterion of the value of any scientific theory must ultimately be its capacity for offering a simple, unified, coherent and fruitful description of observed facts. In proportion as a theory becomes complex it loses in usefulness—a theory which is obliged to requisition a whole array of arbitrary assumptions in order to explain special facts is practically worse than useless, as it serves to disjoin, rather than to unite, the several groups of facts. The optical experiments of the last quarter of the nineteenth century showed the impossibility of constructing a simple ether theory, which would be amenable to analytic treatment and would at the same time stimulate further progress. It should be observed that it could scarcely be shown that no logically consistent ether theory was possible; indeed in 1910, H. A. Wilson offered a consistent ether theory which was at least quite neutral with respect to all available optical data. But Wilson’s ether is almost wholly negative—its only virtue being that it does not directly contradict observed facts. Neither any direct confirmation nor a direct refutation is possible and it does not throw any light on the various optical phenomena. A theory like this being practically useless stands self-condemned.\n",
      "We must now consider the problem of relative motion of ether and matter from the point of view of electrical theory. From 1860 the identity of light as an electromagnetic vector became gradually established as a result of the brilliant “displacement current” hypothesis of Clerk Maxwell and his further analytical investigations. The elastic solid ether became gradually transformed into the electromagnetic one. Maxwell succeeded in giving a fairly satisfactory account of all ordinary optical phenomena and little room was left for any serious doubts as regards the general validity of Maxwell’s theory. Hertz’s researches on electric waves, first carried out in 1886, succeeded in furnishing a strong experimental confirmation of Maxwell’s theory. Electric waves behaved generally like light waves of very large wave length.\n",
      "The orthodox Maxwellian view located the dielectric polarisation in the electromagnetic ether which was merely a transformation of Fresnel’s stagnant ether. The magnetic polarisation was looked upon as wholly secondary in origin, being due to the relative motion of the dielectric tubes of polarisation. On this view the Fresnelian convection coefficient comes out to be ½, as shown by J. J. Thomson in 1880, instead of 1 - (1/μ²) as required by optical experiments. This obviously implies a complete failure to account for all those optical experiments which depend for their satisfactory explanation on the assumption of a value for the convection coefficient equal to 1 - (1/μ²).\n",
      "The modifications proposed independently by Hertz and Heaviside fare no better.[1] They postulated the actual medium to be the seat of all electric polarisation and further emphasised the reciprocal relation subsisting between electricity and magnetism, thus making the field equations more symmetrical. On this view the whole of the polarised ether is carried away by the moving medium, and consequently, the convection coefficient naturally becomes unity in this theory, a value quite as discrepant as that obtained on the original Maxwellian assumption.\n",
      "Thus neither Maxwell’s original theory nor its subsequent modifications as developed by Hertz and Heaviside succeeded in obtaining a value for Fresnelian coefficient equal to 1 - (1/μ2), and consequently stood totally condemned from the optical point of view.\n",
      "Certain direct electromagnetic experiments involving relative motion of polarised dielectrics were no less conclusive against the generalised theory of Hertz and Heaviside. According to Hertz a moving dielectric would carry away the whole of its electric displacement with it. Hence the electromagnetic effect near the moving dielectric would be proportional to the total electric displacement, that is to K, the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric. In 1901, Blondlot working with a stream of moving gas could not detect any such effect. H. A. Wilson repeated the experiment in an improved form in 1903 and working with ebonite found that the observed effect was proportional to K - 1 instead of to K. For gases K is nearly equal to 1 and hence practically no effect will be observed in their case. This gives a satisfactory explanation of Blondlot’s negative results.\n",
      "Rowland had shown in 1876 that the magnetic force due to a rotating condenser (the dielectric remaining stationary) was proportional to K, the sp. ind. cap. On the other hand, Röntgen found in 1888 the magnetic effect due to a rotating dielectric (the condenser remaining stationary) to be proportional to K - 1, and not to K. Finally Eichenwald in 1903 found that when both condenser and dielectric are rotated together, the effect observed was quite independent of K, a result quite consistent with the two previous experiments. The Rowland effect proportional to K, together with the opposite Röntgen effect proportional to 1 - K, makes the Eichenwald effect independent of K.\n",
      "All these experiments together with those of Blondlot and Wilson made it clear that the electromagnetic effect due to a moving dielectric was proportional to K - 1, and not to K as required by Hertz’s theory. Thus the above group of experiments with moving dielectrics directly contradicted the Hertz-Heaviside theory. The internal discrepancies inherent in the classic ether theory had now become too prominent. It was clear that the ether concept had finally outgrown its usefulness. The observed facts had become too contradictory and too heterogeneous to be reduced to an organised whole with the help of the ether concept alone. Radical departures from the classical theory had become absolutely necessary.\n",
      "There were several outstanding difficulties in connection with anomalous dispersion, selective reflection and selective absorption which could not be satisfactory explained in the classic electromagnetic theory. It was evident that the assumption of some kind of discreteness in the optical medium had become inevitable. Such an assumption naturally gave rise to an atomic theory of electricity, namely, the modern electron theory. Lorentz had postulated the existence of electrons so early as 1878, but it was not until some years later that the electron theory became firmly established on a satisfactory basis.\n",
      "Lorentz assumed that a moving dielectric merely carried away its own “polarisation doublets,” which on his theory gave rise to the induced field proportional to K - 1. The field near a moving dielectric is naturally proportional to K - 1 and not to K. Lorentz’s theory thus gave a satisfactory explanation of all those experiments with moving dielectrics which required effects proportional to K - 1. Lorentz further succeeded in obtaining a value for the Fresnelian convection coefficient equal to 1 - 1/μ2, the exact value required by all optical experiments of the moving type.\n",
      "We must now go back to Michelson and Morley’s experiment. We have seen that both parts of the beam are situated in free ether; no material medium is involved in any portion of the paths actually traversed by the beam. Consequently no compensation due to Fresnelian convection of ether by moving medium is possible. Thus Fresnelian convection compensation can have no possible application in this case. Yet some marvellous compensation has evidently taken place which has completely masked the “absolute” velocity of the earth.\n",
      "In Michelson and Morley’s experiment, the distance travelled by the beam along OA (that is, in a direction parallel to the motion of the platform) is 2lβ², while the distance travelled by the beam along OB, perpendicular to the direction of motion of the platform, is 2lβ. Yet the most careful experiments showed, as Eddington says, “that both parts of the beam took the same time as tested by the interference bands produced. It would seem that OA and OB could not really have been of the same length; and if OB was of length l, OA must have been of length l/β. The apparatus was now rotated through 90°, so that OB became the up-stream. The time for the two journeys was again the same, so that 0B must now be the shorter length. The plain meaning of the experiment is that both arms have a length l when placed along Oy (perpendicular to the direction of motion), and automatically contract to a length l/β, when placed along Ox (parallel to the direction of motion). This explanation was first given by Fitz-Gerald.”\n",
      "This Fitz-Gerald contraction, startling enough in itself, does not suffice. Assuming this contraction to be a real one, the distance travelled with respect to the ether is 2lβ and the time taken for this journey is 2lβ/c. But the distance travelled with respect to the platform is always 2l. Hence the velocity of light with respect to the platform is\n",

      "a variable quantity depending on the “absolute” velocity of the platform. But no trace of such an effect has ever been found. The velocity of light is always found to be quite independent of the velocity of the platform. The present difficulty cannot be solved by any further alteration in the measure of space. The only recourse left open is to alter the measure of time as well, that is, to adopt the concept of “local time.” If a moving clock goes slower so that one ‘real’ second becomes 1/β second as measured in the moving system, the velocity of light relative to the platform will always remain c. We must adopt two very startling hypotheses, namely, the Fitz-Gerald contraction and the concept of “local time,” in order to give a satisfactory explanation of the Michelson-Morley experiment.\n",
      "These results were already reached by Lorentz in the course of further developments of his electron theory. Lorentz used a special set of transformation equations[2] for time which implicitly introduced the concept of local time. But he himself failed to attach any special significance to it, and looked upon it rather as a mere mathematical artifice like imaginary quantities in analysis or the circle at infinity in projective geometry. The originality of Einstein at this stage consists in his successful physical interpretation of these results, and viewing them as the coherent organised consequences of a single general principle. Lorentz established the Relativity Theorem[3] (consisting merely of a set of transformation equations) while Einstein generalised it into a Universal Principle. In addition Einstein introduced fundamentally new concepts of space and time, which served to destroy old fetishes and demanded a wholesale revision of scientific concepts and thus opened up new possibilities in the synthetic unification of natural processes.\n",
      "Newton had framed his laws of motion in such a way as to make them quite independent of the absolute velocity of the earth. Uniform relative motion of ether and matter could not be detected with the help of dynamical laws. According to Einstein neither could it be detected with the help of optical or electromagnetic experiments. Thus the Einsteinian Principle of Relativity asserts that all physical laws are independent of the ‘absolute’ velocity of an observer.\n",
      "For different systems, the form of all physical laws is conserved. If we chose the velocity of light[4] to be the fundamental unit of measurement for all observers (that is, assume the constancy of the velocity of light in all systems) we can establish a metric “one-one” correspondence between any two observed systems, such correspondence depending only the relative velocity of the two systems. Einstein’s Relativity is thus merely the consistent logical application of the well known physical principle that we can know nothing but relative motion. In this sense it is a further extension of Newtonian Relativity.\n",
      "On this interpretation, the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction and “local time” lose their arbitrary character. Space and time as measured by two different observers are naturally diverse, and the difference depends only on their relative motion. Both are equally valid; they are merely different descriptions of the same physical reality. This is essentially the point of view adopted by Minkowski. He considers time itself to be one of the co-ordinate axes, and in his four-dimensional world, that is in the space-time reality, relative motion is reduced to a rotation of the axes of reference. Thus, the diversity in the measurement of lengths and temporal rates is merely due to the static difference in the “frame-work” of the different observers.\n",
      "The above theory of Relativity absorbed practically the whole of the electromagnetic theory based on the Maxwell-Lorentz system of field equations. It combined all the advantages of classic Maxwellian theory together with an electronic hypothesis. The Lorentz assumption of polarisation doublets had furnished a satisfactory explanation of the Fresnelian convection of ether, but in the new theory this is deduced merely as a consequence of the altered concept of relative velocity. In addition, the theory of Relativity accepted the results of Michelson and Morley’s experiments as a definite principle, namely, the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, so that there was nothing left for explanation in the Michelson-Morley experiment. But even more than all this, it established a single general principle which served to connect together in a simple coherent and fruitful manner the known facts of Physics.\n",
      "The theory of Relativity received direct experimental confirmation in several directions. Repeated attempts were made to detect the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction. Any ordinary physical contraction will usually have observable physical results; for example, the total electrical resistance of a conductor will diminish. Trouton and Noble, Trouton and Rankine, Rayleigh and Brace, and others employed a variety of different methods to detect the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction, but invariably with the same negative results. Whether there is an ether or not, uniform velocity with respect to it can never be detected. This does not prove that there is no such thing as an ether but certainly does render the ether entirely superfluous. Universal compensation is due to a change in local units of length and time, or rather, being merely different descriptions of the same reality, there is no compensation at all.\n",
      "There was another group of observed phenomena which could scarcely be fitted into a Newtonian scheme of dynamics without doing violence to it. The experimental work of Kaufmann, in 1901, made it abundantly clear that the “mass” of an electron depended on its velocity. So early as 1881, J. J. Thomson had shown that the inertia of a charged particle increased with its velocity. Abraham now deduced a formula for the variation of mass with velocity, on the hypothesis that an electron always remained a rigid sphere. Lorentz proceeded on the assumption that the electron shared in the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction and obtained a totally different formula. A very careful series of measurements carried out independently by Bücherer, Wolz, Hupka and finally Neumann in 1913, decided conclusively in favour of the Lorentz formula. This “contractile” formula follows immediately as a direct consequence of the new Theory of Relativity, without any assumption as regards the electrical origin of inertia. Thus the complete agreement of experimental facts with the predictions of the new theory must be considered as confirming it as a principle which goes even beyond the electron itself. The greatest triumph of this new theory consists, indeed, in the fact that a large number of results, which had formerly required all kinds of special hypotheses for their explanation, are now deduced very simply as inevitable consequences of one single general principle.\n",
      "We have now traced the history of the development of the restricted or special theory of Relativity, which is mainly concerned with optical and electrical phenomena. It was first offered by Einstein in 1905. Ten years later, Einstein formulated his second theory, the Generalised Principle of Relativity. This new theory is mainly a theory of gravitation and has very little connection with optics and electricity. In one sense, the second theory is indeed a further generalisation of the restricted principle, but the former does not really contain the latter as a special case.\n",
      "Einstein’s first theory is restricted in the sense that it only refers to uniform rectilinear motion and has no application to any kind of accelerated movements. Einstein in his second theory extends the Relativity Principle to cases of accelerated motion. If Relativity is to be universally true, then even accelerated motion must be merely relative motion between matter and matter. Hence the Generalised Principle of Relativity asserts that “absolute” motion cannot be detected even with the help of gravitational laws.\n",
      "All movements must be referred to definite sets of co-ordinate axes. If there is any change of axes, the numerical magnitude of the movements will also change. But according to Newtonian dynamics, such alteration in physical movements can only be due to the effect of certain forces in the field.[5] Thus any change of axes will introduce new “geometrical” forces in the field which are quite independent of the nature of the body acted on. Gravitational forces also have this same remarkable property, and gravitation itself may be of essentially the same nature as these “geometrical” forces introduced by a change of axes. This leads to Einstein’s famous Principle of Equivalence. A gravitational field of force is strictly equivalent to one introduced by a transformation of co-ordinates and no possible experiment can distinguish between the two.\n",
      "Thus it may become possible to “transform away” gravitational effects, at least for sufficiently small regions of space, by referring all movements to a new set of axes. This new “framework” may of course have all kinds of very complicated movements when referred to the old Galilean or “rectangular unaccelerated system of co-ordinates.”\n",
      "But there is no reason why we should look upon the Galilean system as more fundamental than any other. If it is found simpler to refer all motion in a gravitational field to a special set of co-ordinates, we may certainly look upon this special “framework” (at least for the particular region concerned), to be more fundamental and more natural. We may, still more simply, identify this particular framework with the special local properties of space in that region. That is, we can look upon the effects of a gravitational field as simply due to the local properties of space and time itself. The very presence of matter implies a modification of the characteristics of space and time in its neighbourhood. As Eddington says “matter does not cause the curvature of space-time. It is the curvature. Just as light does not cause electromagnetic oscillations; it is the oscillations.”\n",
      "We may look upon this from a slightly different point of view. The General Principle of Relativity asserts that all motion is merely relative motion between matter and matter, and as all movements must be referred to definite sets of co-ordinates, the ground of any possible framework must ultimately be material in character. It is convenient to take the matter actually present in a field as the fundamental ground of our framework. If this is done, the special characteristics of our framework would naturally depend on the actual distribution of matter in the field. But physical space and time is completely defined by the “framework.” In other words the “framework” itself is space and time. Hence we see how physical space and time is actually defined by the local distribution of matter.\n",
      "There are certain magnitudes which remain constant by any change of axes. In ordinary geometry distance between two points is one such magnitude; so that δx² + δy² + δz² is an invariant. In the restricted theory of light, the principle of constancy of light velocity demands that δx² + δy² + δz² - c²δt² should remain constant.\n",
      "The separation ds of adjacent events is defined by ds² = -dx² - dy² - dz² + c²dt². It is an extension of the notion of distance and this is the new invariant. Now if x, y, z, t are transformed to any set of new variables x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, we shall get a quadratic expression for\n",
      "\n",
      "where the g’s are functions of x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄ depending on the transformation.\n",
      "The special properties of space and time in any region are defined by these g’s which are themselves determined by the actual distribution of matter in the locality. Thus from the Newtonian point of view, these g’s represent the gravitational effect of matter while from the Relativity stand-point, these merely define the non-Newtonian (and incidentally non-Euclidean) space in the neighbourhood of matter.\n",
      "We have seen that Einstein’s theory requires local curvature of space-time in the neighbourhood of matter. Such altered characteristics of space and time give a satisfactory explanation of an outstanding discrepancy in the observed advance of perihelion of Mercury. The large discordance is almost completely removed by Einstein’s theory.\n",
      "Again, in an intense gravitational field, a beam of light will be affected by the local curvature of space, so that to an observer who is referring all phenomena to a Newtonian system, the beam of light will appear to deviate from its path along an Euclidean straight line.\n",
      "This famous prediction of Einstein about the deflection of a beam of light by the sun’s gravitational field was tested during the total solar eclipse of May, 1919. The observed deflection is decisively in favour of the Generalised Theory of Relativity.\n",
      "It should be noted however that the velocity of light itself would decrease in a gravitational field. This may appear at first sight to be a violation of the principle of constancy of light-velocity. But when we remember that the Special Theory is explicitly restricted to the case of unaccelerated motion, the difficulty vanishes. In the absence of a gravitational field, that is in any unaccelerated system, the velocity of light will always remain constant. Thus the validity of the Special Theory is completely preserved within its own restricted field.\n",
      "Einstein has proposed a third crucial test. He has predicted a shift of spectral lines towards the red, due to an intense gravitational potential. Experimental difficulties are very considerable here, as the shift of spectral lines is a complex phenomenon. Evidence is conflicting and nothing conclusive can yet be asserted. Einstein thought that a gravitational displacement of the Fraunhofer lines is a necessary and fundamental condition for the acceptance of his theory. But Eddington has pointed out that even if this test fails, the logical conclusion would seem to be that while Einstein’s law of gravitation is true for matter in bulk, it is not true for such small material systems as atomic oscillator.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "From the conceptual stand-point there are several important consequences of the Generalised or Gravitational Theory of Relativity. Physical space-time is perceived to be intimately connected with the actual local distribution of matter. Euclid-Newtonian space-time is not the actual space-time of Physics, simply because the former completely neglects the actual presence of matter. Euclid-Newtonian continuum is merely an abstraction, while physical space-*time is the actual framework which has some definite curvature due to the presence of matter. Gravitational Theory of Relativity thus brings out clearly the fundamental distinction between actual physical space-time (which is non-isotropic and non-Euclid-Newtonian) on one hand and the abstract Euclid-Newtonian continuum (which is homogeneous, isotropic and a purely intellectual construction) on the other.\n",
      "The measurements of the rotation of the earth reveals a fundamental framework which may be called the “inertial framework.” This constitutes the actual physical universe. This universe approaches Galilean space-time at a great distance from matter.\n",
      "The properties of this physical universe may be referred to some world-distribution of matter or the “inertial framework” may be constructed by a suitable modification of the law of gravitation itself. In Einstein’s theory the actual curvature of the “inertial framework” is referred to vast quantities of undetected world-matter. It has interesting consequences. The dimensions of Einsteinian universe would depend on the quantity of matter in it; it would vanish to a point in the total absence of matter. Then again curvature depends on the quantity of matter, and hence in the presence of a sufficient quantity of matter space-time may curve round and close up. Einsteinian universe will then reduce to a finite system without boundaries, like the surface of a sphere. In this “closed up” system, light rays will come to a focus after travelling round the universe and we should see an “anti-sun” (corresponding to the back surface of the sun) at a point in the sky opposite to the real sun. This anti-sun would of course be equally large and equally bright if there is no absorption of light in free space.\n",
      "In de Sitter’s theory, the existence of vast quantities of world-matter is not required. But beyond a definite distance from an observer, time itself stands still, so that to the observer nothing can ever “happen” there. All these theories are still highly speculative in character, but they have certainly extended the scope of theoretical physics to the central problem of the ultimate nature of the universe itself.\n",
      "One outstanding peculiarity still attaches to the concept of electric force—it is not amenable to any process of being “transformed away” by a suitable change of framework. H. Weyl, it seems, has developed a geometrical theory (in hyper-space) in which no fundamental distinction is made between gravitational and electrical forces.\n",
      "Einstein’s theory connects up the law of gravitation with the laws of motion, and serves to establish a very intimate relationship between matter and physical space-*time. Space, time and matter (or energy) were considered to be the three ultimate elements in Physics. The restricted theory fused space-time into one indissoluble whole. The generalised theory has further synthesised space-time and matter into one fundamental physical reality. Space, time and matter taken separately are more abstractions. Physical reality consists of a synthesis of all three.\n",
      "P. C. Mahalanobis.\n",
      "Note A.\n",
      "For example consider a massive particle resting on a circular disc. If we set the disc rotating, a centrifugal force appears in the field. On the other hand, if we transform to a set of rotating axes, we must introduce a centrifugal force in order to correct for the change of axes. This newly introduced centrifugal force is usually looked upon as a mathematical fiction—as “geometrical” rather than physical. The presence of such a geometrical force is usually interpreted as being due to the adoption of a fictitious framework. On the other hand a gravitational force is considered quite real. Thus a fundamental distinction is made between geometrical and gravitational forces.\n",
      "In the General Theory of Relativity, this fundamental distinction is done away with. The very possibility of distinguishing between geometrical and gravitational forces is denied. All axes of reference may now be regarded as equally valid.\n",
      "In the Restricted Theory, all “unaccelerated” axes of reference were recognised as equally valid, so that physical laws were made independent of uniform absolute velocity. In the General Theory, physical laws are made independent of “absolute” motion of any kind.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION.\n",
      "It is well known that if we attempt to apply Maxwell’s electrodynamics, as conceived at the present time, to moving bodies, we are led to asymmetry which does not agree with observed phenomena. Let us think of the mutual action between a magnet and a conductor. The observed phenomena in this case depend only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, while according to the usual conception, a distinction must be made between the cases where the one or the other of the bodies is in motion. If, for example, the magnet moves and the conductor is at rest, then an electric field of certain energy-value is produced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, which excites a current in those parts of the field where a conductor exists. But if the magnet be at rest and the conductor be set in motion, no electric field is produced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, but an electromotive force which corresponds to no energy in itself is produced in the conductor; this causes an electric current of the same magnitude and the same career as the electric force, it being of course assumed that the relative motion in both of these cases is the same.\n",
      "2. Examples of a similar kind such as the unsuccessful attempt to substantiate the motion of the earth relative to the “Light-medium” lead us to the supposition that not only in mechanics, but also in electrodynamics, no properties of observed facts correspond to a concept of absolute rest; but that for all coordinate systems for which the mechanical equations hold, the equivalent electrodynamical and optical equations hold also, as has already been shown for magnitudes of the first order. In the following we make these assumptions (which we shall subsequently call the Principle of Relativity) and introduce the further assumption,—an assumption which is at the first sight quite irreconcilable with the former one—that light is propagated in vacant space, with a velocity c which is independent of the nature of motion of the emitting body. These two assumptions are quite sufficient to give us a simple and consistent theory of electrodynamics of moving bodies on the basis of the Maxwellian theory for bodies at rest. The introduction of a “Lightäther” will be proved to be superfluous, for according to the conceptions which will be developed, we shall introduce neither a space absolutely at rest, and endowed with special properties, nor shall we associate a velocity-vector with a point in which electro-magnetic processes take place.\n",
      "3. Like every other theory in electrodynamics, the theory is based on the kinematics of rigid bodies; in the enunciation of every theory, we have to do with relations between rigid bodies (co-ordinate system), clocks, and electromagnetic processes. An insufficient consideration of these circumstances is the cause of difficulties with which the electrodynamics of moving bodies have to fight at present.\n",
      "I.—KINEMATICAL PORTION.\n",
      "§ 1. Definition of Synchronism.\n",
      "Let us have a co-ordinate system, in which the Newtonian equations hold. For distinguishing this system from another which will be introduced hereafter, we shall always call it “the stationary system.”\n",
      "If a material point be at rest in this system, then its position in this system can be found out by a measuring rod, and can be expressed by the methods of Euclidean Geometry, or in Cartesian co-ordinates.\n",
      "If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, the values of its coordinates must be expressed as functions of time. It is always to be borne in mind that such a mathematical definition has a physical sense, only when we have a clear notion of what is meant by time. We have to take into consideration the fact that those of our conceptions, in which time plays a part, are always conceptions of synchronism. For example, we say that a train arrives here at 7 o’clock; this means that the exact pointing of the little hand of my watch to 7, and the arrival of the train are synchronous events.\n",
      "It may appear that all difficulties connected with the definition of time can be removed when in place of time, we substitute the position of the little hand of my watch. Such a definition is in fact sufficient, when it is required to define time exclusively for the place at which the clock is stationed. But the definition is not sufficient when it is required to connect by time events taking place at different stations,—or what amounts to the same thing,—to estimate by means of time (zeitlich werten) the occurrence of events, which take place at stations distant from the clock.\n",
      "Now with regard to this attempt;—the time-estimation of events, we can satisfy ourselves in the following manner. Suppose an observer—who is stationed at the origin of coordinates with the clock—associates a ray of light which comes to him through space, and gives testimony to the event of which the time is to be estimated,—with the corresponding position of the hands of the clock. But such an association has this defect,—it depends on the position of the observer provided with the clock, as we know by experience. We can attain to a more practicable result by the following treatment.\n",
      "If an observer be stationed at A with a clock, he can estimate the time of events occurring in the immediate neighbourhood of A, by looking for the position of the hands of the clock, which are synchronous with the event. If an observer be stationed at B with a clock,—we should add that the clock is of the same nature as the one at A,—he can estimate the time of events occurring about B. But without further premises, it is not possible to compare, as far as time is concerned, the events at B with the events at A. We have hitherto an A-time, and a B-time, but no time common to A and B. This last time (i.e., common time) can be defined, if we establish by definition that the time which light requires in travelling from A to B is equivalent to the time which light requires in travelling from B to A. For example, a ray of light proceeds from A at A-time tA towards B, arrives and is reflected from B at B-time tB, and returns to A at A-time t′A. According to the definition, both clocks are synchronous, if\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "tB - tA = t′A - tB.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We assume that this definition of synchronism is possible without involving any inconsistency, for any number of points, therefore the following relations hold:—\n",
      "1. If the clock at B be synchronous with the clock at A, then the clock at A is synchronous with the clock at B.\n",
      "2. If the clock at A as well as the clock at B are both synchronous with the clock at C, then the clocks at A and B are synchronous.\n",
      "Thus with the help of certain physical experiences, we have established what we understand when we speak of clocks at rest at different stations, and synchronous with one another; and thereby we have arrived at a definition of synchronism and time.\n",
      "In accordance with experience we shall assume that the magnitude\n",
      "\n",
      "where c is a universal constant.\n",
      "We have defined time essentially with a clock at rest in a stationary system. On account of its adaptability to the stationary system, we call the time defined in this way as “time of the stationary system.”\n",

      "The following reflections are based on the Principle of Relativity and on the Principle of Constancy of the velocity of light, both of which we define in the following way:—\n",
      "1. The laws according to which the nature of physical systems alter are independent of the manner in which these changes are referred to two co-ordinate systems which have a uniform translators motion relative to each other.\n",
      "2. Every ray of light moves in the “stationary co-ordinate system” with the same velocity c, the velocity being independent of the condition whether this ray of light is emitted by a body at rest or in motion.[6] Therefore\n",

      "where, by ‘interval of time’ we mean time as defined in §1.\n",
      "Let us have a rigid rod at rest; this has a length l, when measured by a measuring rod at rest; we suppose that the axis of the rod is laid along the X-axis of the system at rest, and then a uniform velocity v, parallel to the axis of X, is imparted to it. Let us now enquire about the length of the moving rod; this can be obtained by either of these operations.—\n",
      "(a) The observer provided with the measuring rod moves along with the rod to be measured, and measures by direct superposition the length of the rod:—just as if the observer, the measuring rod, and the rod to be measured were at rest.\n",
      "(b) The observer finds out, by means of clocks placed in a system at rest (the clocks being synchronous as defined in §1), the points of this system where the ends of the rod to be measured occur at a particular time t. The distance between these two points, measured by the previously used measuring rod, this time it being at rest, is a length, which we may call the “length of the rod.”\n",
      "According to the Principle of Relativity, the length found out by the operation a), which we may call “the length of the rod in the moving system” is equal to the length l of the rod in the stationary system.\n",
      "The length which is found out by the second method, may be called ‘the length of the moving rod measured from the stationary system.’ This length is to be estimated on the basis of our principle, and we shall find it to be different from l.\n",
      "In the generally recognised kinematics, we silently assume that the lengths defined by these two operations are equal, or in other words, that at an epoch of time t, a moving rigid body is geometrically replaceable by the same body, which can replace it in the condition of rest.\n",
      "Relativity of Time.\n",
      "Let us suppose that the two clocks synchronous with the clocks in the system at rest are brought to the ends A, and B of a rod, i.e., the time of the clocks correspond to the time of the stationary system at the points where they happen to arrive; these clocks are therefore synchronous in the stationary system.\n",
      "We further imagine that there are two observers at the two watches, and moving with them, and that these observers apply the criterion for synchronism to the two clocks. At the time tA, a ray of light goes out from A, is reflected from B at the time tB, and arrives back at A at time t′A.

Therefore the observers stationed with the watches will not find the clocks synchronous, though the observer in the stationary system must declare the clocks to be synchronous. We therefore see that we can attach no absolute significance to the concept of synchronism; but two events which are synchronous when viewed from one system, will not be synchronous when viewed from a system moving relatively to this system.\n",

Let a rigid measuring rod, and a number of clocks be given to each of the systems, and let the rods and clocks in each be exactly alike each other.\n",
      "Let the initial point of one of the systems (k) have a constant velocity in the direction of the X-axis of the other which is stationary system K, the motion being also communicated to the rods and clocks in the system (k). Any time t of the stationary system K corresponds to a definite position of the axes of the moving system, which are always parallel to the axes of the stationary system. By t, we always mean the time in the stationary system.\n",
      "We suppose that the space is measured by the stationary measuring rod placed in the stationary system, as well as by the moving measuring rod placed in the moving system, and we thus obtain the co-ordinates (x, y, z) for the stationary system, and (ξ, η, ζ) for the moving system. Let the time t be determined for each point of the stationary system (which are provided with clocks) by means of the clocks which are placed in the stationary system, with the help of light-signals as described in § 1. Let also the time τ of the moving system be determined for each point of the moving system (in which there are clocks which are at rest relative to the moving system), by means of the method of light signals between these points (in which there are clocks) in the manner described in § 1.\n",

      "It is clear that similar results hold about stationary bodies in a stationary system when considered from a uniformly moving system.\n",
      "Let us now consider that a clock which is lying at rest in the stationary system gives the time t, and lying at rest relative to the moving system is capable of giving the time τ; suppose it to be placed at the origin of the moving system k, and to be so arranged that it gives the time τ.

      "Therefore the clock loses by an amount ½(v²/c²) per second of motion, to the second order of approximation.\n",
      "From this, the following peculiar consequence follows. Suppose at two points A and B of the stationary system two clocks are given which are synchronous in the sense explained in § 3 when viewed from the stationary system. Suppose the clock at A to be set in motion in the line joining it with B, then after the arrival of the clock at B, they will no longer be found synchronous, but the clock which was set in motion from A will lag behind the clock which had been all along at B by an amount ½t(v²/c²), where t is the time required for the journey.\n",
      "We see forthwith that the result holds also when the clock moves from A to B by a polygonal line, and also when A and B coincide.\n",
      "If we assume that the result obtained for a polygonal line holds also for a curved line, we obtain the following law. If at A, there be two synchronous clocks, and if we set in motion one of them with a constant velocity along a closed curve till it comes back to A, the journey being completed in t-seconds, then after arrival, the last mentioned clock will be behind the stationary one by ½t(v²/c²) seconds.

Let us have a point-mass of electricity which is of magnitude unity in the stationary system K, i.e., it exerts a unit force upon a similar quantity placed at a distance of 1 cm. If this quantity of electricity be at rest in the stationary system, then the force acting upon it is equivalent to the vector (X, Y, Z) of electric force. But if the quantity of electricity be at rest relative to the moving system (at least for the moment considered), then the force acting upon it, and measured in the moving system is equivalent to the vector (X′, Y′, Z′). The first three of equations (1), (2), (3), can be expressed in the following way:—\n",
      "1. If a point-mass of electric unit pole moves in an electro-magnetic field, then besides the electric force, an electromotive force acts upon it, which, neglecting the numbers involving the second and higher powers of v/c, is equivalent to the vector-product of the velocity vector, and the magnetic force divided by the velocity of light (Old mode of expression).\n",
      "2. If a point-mass of electric unit pole moves in an electro-magnetic field, then the force acting upon it is equivalent to the electric force existing at the position of the unit pole, which we obtain by the transformation of the field to a co-ordinate system which is at rest relative to the electric unit pole [New mode of expression].\n",
      "Similar theorems hold with reference to the magnetic force. We see that in the theory developed the electro-magnetic force plays the part of an auxiliary concept, which owes its introduction in theory to the circumstance that the electric and magnetic forces possess no existence independent of the nature of motion of the co-ordinate system.\n",

If the electron moves from the origin of co-ordinates of the system K with the initial velocity 0 steadily along the X-axis under the action of an electromotive force X, then it is clear that the energy drawn from the electrostatic field has the value ∫eXdx. Since the electron is only slowly accelerated, and in consequence, no energy is given out in the form of radiation, therefore the energy drawn from the electro-static field may be put equal to the energy W of motion.

      "The name of Prof. Albrecht Einstein has now spread far beyond the narrow pale of scientific investigators owing to the brilliant confirmation of his predicted deflection of light-rays by the gravitational field of the sun during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919. But to the serious student of science, he has been known from the beginning of the current century, and many dark problems in physics has been illuminated with the lustre of his genius, before, owing to the latest sensation just mentioned, he flashes out before public imagination as a scientific star of the first magnitude.\n",
      "Einstein is a Swiss-German of Jewish extraction, and began his scientific career as a privat-dozent in the Swiss University of Zürich about the year 1902. Later on, he migrated to the German University of Prague in Bohemia as ausser-ordentliche (or associate) Professor. In 1914, through the exertions of Prof. M. Planck of the Berlin University, he was appointed a paid member of the Royal (now National) Prussian Academy of Sciences, on a salary of 18,000 marks per year. In this post, he has only to do and guide research work. Another distinguished occupant of the same post was Van’t Hoff, the eminent physical chemist.\n",
      "It is rather difficult to give a detailed, and consistent chronological account of his scientific activities,—they are so variegated, and cover such a wide field. The first work which gained him distinction was an investigation on Brownian Movement. An admirable account will be found in Perrin’s book ‘The Atoms.’ Starting from Boltzmann’s theorem connecting the entropy, and the probability of a state, he deduced a formula on the mean displacement of small particles (colloidal) suspended in a liquid. This formula gives us one of the best methods for finding out a very fundamental number in physics—namely—the number of molecules in one gm. molecule of gas (Avogadro’s number). The formula was shortly afterwards verified by Perrin, Prof. of Chemical Physics in the Sorbonne, Paris.\n",
      "To Einstein is also due the resuscitation of Planck’s quantum theory of energy-emission. This theory has not yet caught the popular imagination to the same extent as the new theory of Time, and Space, but it is none the less iconoclastic in its scope as far as classical concepts are concerned. It was known for a long time that the observed emission of light from a heated black body did not correspond to the formula which could be deduced from the older classical theories of continuous emission and propagation. In the year 1900, Prof. Planck of the Berlin University worked out a formula which was based on the bold assumption that energy was emitted and absorbed by the molecules in multiples of the quantity hν, where h is a constant (which is universal like the constant of gravitation), and ν is the frequency of the light.\n",
      "The conception was so radically different from all accepted theories that in spite of the great success of Planck’s radiation formula in explaining the observed facts of black-body radiation, it did not meet with much favour from the physicists. In fact, some one remarked jocularly that according to Planck, energy flies out of a radiator like a swarm of gnats.\n",
      "But Einstein found a support for the new-born concept in another direction. It was known that if green or ultraviolet light was allowed to fall on a plate of some alkali metal, the plate lost electrons. The electrons were emitted with all velocities, but there is generally a maximum limit. From the investigations of Lenard and Ladenburg, the curious discovery was made that this maximum velocity of emission did not at all depend upon the intensity of light, but upon its wavelength. The more violet was the light, the greater was the velocity of emission.\n",
      "To account for this fact, Einstein made the bold assumption that the light is propagated in space as a unit pulse (he calls it a Light-cell), and falling upon an individual atom, liberates electrons according to the energy equation\n",

      "There was little material for the confirmation of this law when it was first proposed (1905), and eleven years elapsed before Prof. Millikan established, by a set of experiments scarcely rivalled for the ingenuity, skill, and care displayed, the absolute truth of the law. As results of this confirmation, and other brilliant triumphs, the quantum law is now regarded as a fundamental law of Energetics. In recent years, X-rays have been added to the domain of light, and in this direction also, Einstein’s photo-electric formula has proved to be one of the most fruitful conceptions in Physics.\n",
      "The quantum law was next extended by Einstein to the problems of decrease of specific heat at low temperature, and here also his theory was confirmed in a brilliant manner.\n",
      "We pass over his other contributions to the equation of state, to the problems of null-point energy, and photo-chemical reactions. The recent experimental works of Nernst and Warburg seem to indicate that through Einstein’s genius, we are probably for the first time having a satisfactory theory of photo-chemical action.\n",
      "In 1915, Einstein made an excursion into Experimental Physics, and here also, in his characteristic way, he tackled one of the most fundamental concepts of Physics. It is well-known that according to Ampere, the magnetisation of iron and iron-like bodies, when placed within a coil carrying an electric current is due to the excitation in the metal of small electrical circuits. But the conception though a very fruitful one, long remained without a trace of experimental proof, though after the discovery of the electron, it was generally believed that these molecular currents may be due to the rotational motion of free electrons within the metal. It is easily seen that if in the process of magnetisation, a number of electrons be set into rotatory motion, then these will impart to the metal itself a turning couple. The experiment is a rather difficult one, and many physicists tried in vain to observe the effect. But in collaboration with de Haas, Einstein planned and successfully carried out this experiment, and proved the essential correctness of Ampere’s views.\n",
      "Einstein’s studies on Relativity were commenced in the year 1905, and has been continued up to the present time. The first paper in the present collection forms Einstein’s first great contribution to the Principle of Special Relativity. We have recounted in the introduction how out of the chaos and disorder into which the electrodynamics and optics of moving bodies had fallen previous to 1895, Lorentz, Einstein and Minkowski have succeeded in building up a consistent, and fruitful new theory of Time and Space.\n",
      "But Einstein was not satisfied with the study of the special problem of Relativity for uniform motion, but tried, in a series of papers beginning from 1911, to extend it to the case of non-uniform motion. The last paper in the present collection is a translation of a comprehensive article which he contributed to the Annalen der Physik in 1916 on this subject, and gives, in his own words, the Principles of Generalized Relativity. The triumphs of this theory are now matters of public knowledge.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION.\n",
      "At the present time, different opinions are being held about the fundamental equations of Electro-dynamics for moving bodies. The Hertzian[9] forms must be given up, for it has appeared that they are contrary to many experimental results.\n",
      "In 1895 H. A. Lorentz[10] published his theory of optical and electrical phenomena in moving bodies; this theory was based upon the atomistic conception (vorstellung) of electricity, and on account of its great success appears to have justified the bold hypotheses, by which it has been ushered into existence. In his theory, Lorentz proceeds from certain equations, which must hold at every point of “Äther”; then by forming the average values over “Physically infinitely small” regions, which however contain large numbers of electrons, the equations for electro-magnetic processes in moving bodies can be successfully built up.\n",
      "In particular, Lorentz’s theory gives a good account of the non-existence of relative motion of the earth and the luminiferous “Äther”; it shows that this fact is intimately connected with the covariance of the original equation, when certain simultaneous transformations of the space and time co-ordinates are effected; these transformations have therefore obtained from H. Poincare[11] the name of Lorentz-transformations. The covariance of these fundamental equations, when subjected to the Lorentz-transformation is a purely mathematical fact i.e. not based on any physical considerations; I will call this the Theorem of Relativity; this theorem rests essentially on the form of the differential equations for the propagation of waves with the velocity of light.\n",
      "Now without recognizing any hypothesis about the connection between “Äther” and matter, we can expect these mathematically evident theorems to have their consequences so far extended—that thereby even those laws of ponderable media which are yet unknown may anyhow possess this covariance when subjected to a Lorentz-transformation; by saying this, we do not indeed express an opinion, but rather a conviction,—and this conviction I may be permitted to call the Postulate of Relativity. The position of affairs here is almost the same as when the Principle of Conservation of Energy was postulated in cases, where the corresponding forms of energy were unknown.\n",
      "Now if hereafter, we succeed in maintaining this covariance as a definite connection between pure and simple observable phenomena in moving bodies, the definite connection may be styled ‘the Principle of Relativity.’\n",
      "These differentiations seem to me to be necessary for enabling us to characterise the present day position of the electro-dynamics for moving bodies.\n",
      "H. A. Lorentz[12] has found out the “Relativity theorem” and has created the Relativity-postulate as a hypothesis that electrons and matter suffer contractions in consequence of their motion according to a certain law.\n",
      "A. Einstein[13] has brought out the point very clearly, that this postulate is not an artificial hypothesis but is rather a new way of comprehending the time-concept which is forced upon us by observation of natural phenomena.\n",
      "The Principle of Relativity has not yet been formulated for electro-dynamics of moving bodies in the sense characterized by me. In the present essay, while formulating this principle, I shall obtain the fundamental equations for moving bodies in a sense which is uniquely determined by this principle.\n",
      "But it will be shown that none of the forms hitherto assumed for these equations can exactly fit in with this principle.[14]\n",
      "We would at first expect that the fundamental equations which are assumed by Lorentz for moving bodies would correspond to the Relativity Principle. But it will be shown that this is not the case for the general equations which Lorentz has for any possible, and also for magnetic bodies; but this is approximately the case (if neglect the square of the velocity of matter in comparison to the velocity of light) for those equations which Lorentz hereafter infers for non-magnetic bodies. But this latter accordance with the Relativity Principle is due to the fact that the condition of non-magnetisation has been formulated in a way not corresponding to the Relativity Principle; therefore the accordance is due to the fortuitous compensation of two contradictions to the Relativity-Postulate. But meanwhile enunciation of the Principle in a rigid manner does not signify any contradiction to the hypotheses of Lorentz’s molecular theory, but it shall become clear that the assumption of the contraction of the electron in Lorentz’s theory must be introduced at an earlier stage than Lorentz has actually done.\n",
      "In an appendix, I have gone into discussion of the position of Classical Mechanics with respect to the Relativity Postulate. Any easily perceivable modification of mechanics for satisfying the requirements of the Relativity theory would hardly afford any noticeable difference in observable processes; but would lead to very surprising consequences. By laying down the Relativity-Postulate from the outset, sufficient means have been created for deducing henceforth the complete series of Laws of Mechanics from the principle of conservation of Energy alone (the form of the Energy being given in explicit forms).\n",

      "Let a rectangular system (x, y, z, t,) of reference be given in space and time. The unit of time shall be chosen in such a manner with reference to the unit of length that the velocity of light in space becomes unity.\n",
      "Although I would prefer not to change the notations used by Lorentz, it appears important to me to use a different selection of symbols, for thereby certain homogeneity will appear from the very beginning. I shall denote the vector electric force by E, the magnetic induction by M, the electric induction by e and the magnetic force by m, so that (E, M, e, m) are used instead of Lorentz’s (E, B, D, H) respectively.\n",
      "I shall further make use of complex magnitudes in a way which is not yet current in physical investigations, i.e., instead of operating with (t), I shall operate with (i t), where i denotes √(-1). If now instead of (x, y, z, i t), I use the method of writing with indices, certain essential circumstances will come into evidence; on this will be based a general use of the suffixes (1, 2, 3, 4). The advantage of this method will be, as I expressly emphasize here, that we shall have to handle symbols which have apparently a purely real appearance; we can however at any moment pass to real equations if it is understood that of the symbols with indices, such ones as have the suffix 4 only once, denote imaginary quantities, while those which have not at all the suffix 4, or have it twice denote real quantities.\n",

      "By the Lorentz transformation, we are allowed to effect certain changes of the time parameter. In consequence of this fact, it is no longer permissible to speak of the absolute simultaneity of two events. The ordinary idea of simultaneity rather presupposes that six independent parameters, which are evidently required for defining a system of space and time axes, are somehow reduced to three. Since we are accustomed to consider that these limitations represent in a unique way the actual facts very approximately, we maintain that the simultaneity of two events exists of themselves.[18] In fact, the following considerations will prove conclusive.\n",
      "Let a reference system (x, y, z, t) for space time points (events) be somehow known. Now if a space point A (x₀, y₀, z₀) the time t₀ be compared with a space point P (x, y, z) at the time t, and if the difference of time t - t₀, (let t > t₀) be less than the length A P i.e. less than the time required for the propagation of light from A to P, and if q = (t - t₀)/(A P) < 1, then by a special Lorentz transformation, in which A P is taken as the axis, and which has the moment q, we can introduce a time parameter t′, which (see equation 11, 12, § 4) has got the same value t′ = 0 for both space-time points (A, t₀), and (P, t). So the two events can now be comprehended to be simultaneous.\n",
      "Further, let us take at the same time t₀ = 0, two different space-points A, B, or three space-points (A, B, C) which are not in the same space-line, and compare therewith a space point P, which is outside the line A B, or the plane A B C, at another time t, and let the time difference t - t₀ (t > t₀) be less than the time which light requires for propagation from the line A B, or the plane (A B C) to P. Let q be the quotient of (t - t₀) by the second time. Then if a Lorentz transformation is taken in which the perpendicular from P on A B, or from P on the plane A B C is the axis, and q is the moment, then all the three (or four) events (A, t₀), (B, t₀), (C, t₀) and (P, t) are simultaneous.\n",
      "If four space-points, which do not lie in one plane, are conceived to be at the same time t₀, then it is no longer permissible to make a change of the time parameter by a Lorentz-transformation, without at the same time destroying the character of the simultaneity of these four space points.\n",
      "To the mathematician, accustomed on the one hand to the methods of treatment of the poly-dimensional manifold, and on the other hand to the conceptual figures of the so-called non-Euclidean Geometry, there can be no difficulty in adopting this concept of time to the application of the Lorentz-transformation. The paper of Einstein which has been cited in the Introduction, has succeeded to some extent in presenting the nature of the transformation from the physical standpoint.\n",

We look for those relations which make it possible for us—when proper fundamental data are given—to obtain the following quantities at every place and time, and therefore at every space-time point as functions of (x, y, z, t):—the vector of the electric force E, the magnetic induction M, the electrical induction e, the magnetic force m, the electrical space-density ρ, the electric current s (whose relation hereafter to the conduction current is known by the manner in which conductivity occurs in the process), and lastly the vector v, the velocity of matter.\n",

      "When a detached region[19] of matter is at rest at any moment, therefore the vector u is zero, for a system (x, y, z, t)—the neighbourhood may be supposed to be in motion in any possible manner, then for the space-time point x, y, z, t, the same relations (A) (B) (V) which hold in the case when all matter is at rest, shall also hold between ρ, the vectors C, e, m, M, E and their differentials with respect to x, y, z, t. The second axiom shall be:—\n",
      "Every velocity of matter is < 1, smaller than the velocity of propagation of light.[20]\n",
      "The fundamental equations are of such a kind that when (x, y, z, it) are subjected to a Lorentz transformation and thereby (m - ie) and (M - iE) are transformed into space-time vectors of the second kind, (C, iρ) as a space-time vector of the 1st kind, the equations are transformed into essentially identical forms involving the transformed magnitudes.\n",

      "This axiom I call the Principle of Relativity.\n",
      "In fact these three axioms lead us from the previously mentioned fundamental equations for bodies at rest to the equations for moving bodies in an unambiguous way.\n",

      "Let us now fix our attention on a certain point (x, y, z) of matter at a certain time (t). If at this space-time point u = 0, then we have at once for this point the equations (A), (B) (V) of § 7. If u ≠ 0, then there exists according to 16), in case | u | < 1, a special Lorentz-transformation, whose vector v is equal to this vector u (x, y, z, t), and we pass on to a new system of reference (x′ y′ z′ t′) in accordance with this transformation. Therefore for the space-time point considered, there arises as in § 4, the new values 28) ω′₁ = 0, ω′₂ = 0, ω′₃ = 0, ω′₄ = i, therefore the new velocity vector ω′ = 0, the space-time point is as if transformed to rest. Now according to the third axiom the system of equations for the transformed point (x′ y′ z′ t) involves the newly introduced magnitude (u′ ρ′, C′, e′, m′, E′, M′) and their differential quotients with respect to (x′, y′, z′, t′) in the same manner as the original equations for the point (x, y, z, t).

      "In the statement of the fundamental equations, our leading idea had been that they should retain a covariance of form, when subjected to a group of Lorentz-transformations. Now we have to deal with ponderomotive reactions and energy in the electro-magnetic field. Here from the very first there can be no doubt that the settlement of this question is in some way connected with the simplest forms which can be given to the fundamental equations, satisfying the conditions of covariance. In order to arrive at such forms, I shall first of all put the fundamental equations in a typical form which brings out clearly their covariance in case of a Lorentz-transformation. Here I am using a method of calculation, which enables us to deal in a simple manner with the space-time vectors of the 1st, and 2nd kind, and of which the rules, as far as required are given below.\n",

      "\n",
      "A Lecture delivered before the Naturforscher Versammlung (Congress of Natural Philosophers) at Cologne—(21st September, 1908).\n",
      "Gentlemen,\n",
      "The conceptions about time and space, which I hope to develop before you to-day, has grown on experimental physical grounds. Herein lies its strength. The tendency is radical. Henceforth, the old conception of space for itself, and time for itself shall reduce to a mere shadow, and some sort of union of the two will be found consistent with facts.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Now I want to show you how we can arrive at the changed concepts about time and space from mechanics, as accepted now-a-days, from purely mathematical considerations. The equations of Newtonian mechanics show a twofold invariance, (i) their form remains unaltered when we subject the fundamental space-coordinate system to any possible change of position, (ii) when we change the system in its nature of motion, i. e., when we impress upon it any uniform motion of translation, the null-point of time plays no part. We are accustomed to look upon the axioms of geometry as settled once for all, while we seldom have the same amount of conviction regarding the axioms of mechanics, and therefore the two invariants are seldom mentioned in the same breath. Each one of these denotes a certain group of transformations for the differential equations of mechanics. We look upon the existence of the first group as a fundamental characteristics of space. We always prefer to leave off the second group to itself, and with a light heart conclude that we can never decide from physical considerations whether the space, which is supposed to be at rest, may not finally be in uniform motion. So these two groups lead quite separate existences besides each other. Their totally heterogeneous character may scare us away from the attempt to compound them. Yet it is the whole compounded group which as a whole gives us occasion for thought.\n",
      "We wish to picture to ourselves the whole relation graphically. Let (x, y, z) be the rectangular coordinates of space, and t denote the time. Subjects of our perception are always connected with place and time. No one has observed a place except at a particular time, or has observed a time except at a particular place. Yet I respect the dogma that time and space have independent existences. I will call a space-point plus a time-point, i.e., a system of values x, y, z, t, as a world-point. The manifoldness of all possible values of x, y, z, t, will be the world. I can draw four world-axes with the chalk. Now any axis drawn consists of quickly vibrating molecules, and besides, takes part in all the journeys of the earth ; and therefore gives us occasion for reflection. The greater abstraction required for the four-axes does not cause the mathematician any trouble. In order not to allow any yawning gap to exist, we shall suppose that at every place and time, something perceptible exists. In order not to specify either matter or electricity, we shall simply style these as substances. We direct our attention to the world-point x, y, z, t, and suppose that we are in a position to recognise this substantial point at any subsequent time. Let dt be the time element corresponding to the changes of space coordinates of this point [dx, dy, dz]. Then we obtain (as a picture, so to speak, of the perennial life-career of the substantial point),—a curve in the world—the world-line, the points on which unambiguously correspond to the parameter t from +∞ to -∞. The whole world appears to be resolved in such world-lines, and I may just deviate from my point if I say that according to my opinion the physical laws would find their fullest expression as mutual relations among these lines.\n",
      "By this conception of time and space, the (x, y, z) manifoldness t = 0 and its two sides t < 0 and t > 0 falls asunder. If for the sake of simplicity, we keep the null-point of time and space fixed, then the first named group of mechanics signifies that at t = 0 we can give the x, y, and z-axes any possible rotation about the null-point corresponding to the homogeneous linear transformation of the expression\n",

      "The second group denotes that without changing the expression for the mechanical laws, we can substitute (x - αt, y - βt, z - γt for (x, y, z) where (α, β, γ) are any constants. According to this we can give the time-axis any possible direction in the upper half of the world t > 0. Now what have the demands of orthogonality in space to do with this perfect freedom of the time-axis towards the upper half?\n",

      "According to the analogy of the hyperboloid of two sheets, this consists of two sheets separated by t = 0. Let us consider the sheet, in the region of t > 0, and let us now conceive the transformation of x, y, z, t in the new system of variables; (x’, y’, z’, t’) by means of which the form of the expression will remain unaltered. Clearly the rotation of space round the null-point belongs to this group of transformations. Now we can have a full idea of the transformations which we picture to ourselves from a particular transformation in which (y, z) remain unaltered. Let us draw the cross section of the upper sheets with the plane of the x- and t-axes, i.e., the upper half of the hyperbola c²t² - x² = 1, with its asymptotes (vide fig. 1).\n",
      "Then let us draw the radius rector OA′, the tangent A′ B′ at A′, and let us complete the parallelogram OA′ B′ C′; also produce B′ C′ to meet the x-axis at D′. Let us now take Ox′, OA′ as new axes with the unit measuring rods OC′ = 1, OA′ = (1/c) ; then the hyperbola is again expressed in the form c²t′² - x′² = 1, t′ > 0 and the transition from (x, y, z, t) to (x′ y′ z′ t) is one of the transitions in question. Let us add to this characteristic transformation any possible displacement of the space and time null-points; then we get a group of transformation depending only on c, which we may denote by Gc.\n",
      "Now let us increase c to infinity. Thus (1/c) becomes zero and it appears from the figure that the hyperbola is gradually shrunk into the x-axis, the asymptotic angle becomes a straight one, and every special transformation in the limit changes in such a manner that the t-axis can have any possible direction upwards, and x′ more and more approximates to x. Remembering this point it is clear that the full group belonging to Newtonian Mechanics is simply the group Gc, with the value of c = ∞. In this state of affairs, and since Gc is mathematically more intelligible than G∞, a mathematician may, by a free play of imagination, hit upon the thought that natural phenomena possess an invariance not only for the group G∞, but in fact also for a group Gc, where c is finite, but yet exceedingly large compared to the usual measuring units. Such a preconception would be an extraordinary triumph for pure mathematics.\n",
      "At the same time I shall remark for which value of c, this invariance can be conclusively held to be true. For c, we shall substitute the velocity of light c in free space. In order to avoid speaking either of space or of vacuum, we may take this quantity as the ratio between the electrostatic and electro-magnetic units of electricity.\n",
      "We can form an idea of the invariant character of the expression for natural laws for the group-transformation Gc in the following manner.\n",
      "Out of the totality of natural phenomena, we can, by successive higher approximations, deduce a coordinate system (x, y, z, t); by means of this coordinate system, we can represent the phenomena according to definite laws. This system of reference is by no means uniquely determined by the phenomena. We can change the system of reference in any possible manner corresponding to the above-mentioned group transformation Gc, but the expressions for natural laws will not be changed thereby.\n",
      "For example, corresponding to the above described figure, we can call t′ the time, but then necessarily the space connected with it must be expressed by the manifoldness (x′ y z). The physical laws are now expressed by means of x′, y, z, t′,—and the expressions are just the same as in the case of x, y, z, t. According to this, we shall have in the world, not one space, but many spaces,—quite analogous to the case that the three-dimensional space consists of an infinite number of planes. The three-dimensional geometry will be a chapter of four-dimensional physics. Now you perceive, why I said in the beginning that time and space shall reduce to mere shadows and we shall have a world complete in itself.\n",
      "II\n",
      "Now the question may be asked,—what circumstances lead us to these changed views about time and space, are they not in contradiction with observed phenomena, do they finally guarantee us advantages for the description of natural phenomena?\n",
      "Before we enter into the discussion, a very important point must be noticed. Suppose we have individualised time and space in any manner; then a world-line parallel to the t-axis will correspond to a stationary point; a world-line inclined to the t-axis will correspond to a point moving uniformly; and a world-curve will correspond to a point moving in any manner. Let us now picture to our mind the world-line passing through any world point x, y, z, t; now if we find the world-line parallel to the radius vector OA′ of the hyperboloidal sheet, then we can introduce OA′ as a new time-axis, and then according to the new conceptions of time and space the substance will appear to be at rest in the world point concerned. We shall now introduce this fundamental axiom:—\n",

      "shall always be positive or what is equivalent to the same thing, every velocity V should be smaller than c. c shall therefore be the upper limit for all substantial velocities and herein lies a deep significance for the quantity c. At the first impression, the axiom seems to be rather unsatisfactory. It is to be remembered that only a modified mechanics will occur, in which the square root of this differential combination takes the place of time, so that cases in which the velocity is greater than c will play no part, something like imaginary coordinates in geometry.\n",
      "The impulse and real cause of inducement for the assumption of the group-transformation Gc is the fact that the differential equation for the propagation of light in vacant space possesses the group-transformation Gc. On the other hand, the idea of rigid bodies has any sense only in a system mechanics with the group Ginfinity. Now if we have an optics with Gc, and on the other hand if there are rigid bodies, it is easy to see that a t-direction can be defined by the two hyperboloidal shells common to the groups G∞, and Gc, which has got the further consequence, that by means of suitable rigid instruments in the laboratory, we can perceive a change in natural phenomena, in case of different orientations, with regard to the direction of progressive motion of the earth. But all efforts directed towards this object, and even the celebrated interference-experiment of Michelson have given negative results. In order to supply an explanation for this result, H. A. Lorentz formed a hypothesis which practically amounts to an invariance of optics for the group Gc. According to Lorentz every substance shall suffer a contraction\n",

      "I shall show in our figure that Lorentz’s hypothesis is fully equivalent to the new conceptions about time and space. Thereby it may appear more intelligible. Let us now, for the sake of simplicity, neglect (y, z) and fix our attention on a two dimensional world, in which let upright strips parallel to the t-axis represent a state of rest and another parallel strip inclined to the t-axis represent a state of uniform motion for a body, which has a constant spatial extension (see fig. 1). If OA′ is parallel to the second strip, we can take t′ as the t-axis and x′ as the x-axis, then the second body will appear to be at rest, and the first body in uniform motion. We shall now assume that the first body supposed to be at rest, has the length l, i.e., the cross section PP of the first strip upon the x-axis = l. OC, where OC is the unit measuring rod upon the x-axis—and the second body also, when supposed to be at rest, has the same length l, this means that, the cross section Q′Q′ of the second strip has a cross-section l· OC′, when measured parallel to the x′-axis. In these two bodies, we have now images of two Lorentz-electrons, one of which is at rest and the other moves uniformly. Now if we stick to our original coordinates, then the extension of the second electron is given by the cross section QQ of the strip belonging to it measured parallel to the x-axis. Now it is clear since Q′Q′ = l· OC′, that QQ = l· OD′.\n",

      "Lorentz called the combination t′ of (t and x) as the local time (Ortszeit) of the uniformly moving electron, and used a physical construction of this idea for a better comprehension of the contraction-hypothesis. But to perceive clearly that the time of an electron is as good as the time of any other electron, i.e. t, t′ are to be regarded as equivalent, has been the service of A. Einstein [Ann. d. Phys. 891, p. 1905, Jahrb. d. Radis. ... 4-4-11-1907.] There the concept of time was shown to be completely and unambiguously established by natural phenomena. But the concept of space was not arrived at, either by Einstein or Lorentz, probably because in the case of the above-mentioned spatial transformations, where the (x′, t′) plane coincides with the x-t plane, the significance is possible that the x-axis of space some-how remains conserved in its position.\n",
      "We can approach the idea of space in a corresponding manner, though some may regard the attempt as rather fantastical.\n",
      "According to these ideas, the word “Relativity-Postulate” which has been coined for the demands of invariance in the group G, seems to be rather inexpressive for a true understanding of the group Gc, and for further progress. Because the sense of the postulate is that the four-dimensional world is given in space and time by phenomena only, but the projection in time and space can be handled with a certain freedom, and therefore I would rather like to give to this assertion the name “The Postulate of the Absolute world” [World-Postulate].\n",

      "The advantages arising from the formulation of the world-postulate are illustrated by nothing so strikingly as by the expressions which tell us about the reactions exerted by a point-charge moving in any manner according to the Maxwell-Lorentz theory.\n",
      "Let us conceive of the world-line of such an electron with the charge (e), and let us introduce upon it the “Proper-time” τ reckoned from any possible initial point. In order to obtain the field caused by the electron at any world-point P₁ let us construct the fore-cone belonging to P₁ (vide fig. 4). Clearly this cuts the unlimited world-line of the electron at a single point P, because these directions are all time-like vectors. At P, let us draw the tangent to the world-line, and let us draw from P₁ the normal to this tangent. Let r be the measure of P₁Q. According to the definition of a fore-cone, r/e is to be reckoned as the measure of PQ. Now at the world-point P₁, the vector-potential of the field excited by e is represented by the vector in direction PQ, having the magnitude e/cr, in its three space components along the x-, y-, z-axes; the scalar-potential is represented by the component along the t-axis. This is the elementary law found out by A. Lienard, and E. Wiechert.[34]\n",
      "If the field caused by the electron be described in the above-mentioned way, then it will appear that the division of the field into electric and magnetic forces is a relative one, and depends upon the time-axis assumed; the two forces considered together bears some analogy to the force-screw in mechanics; the analogy is, however, imperfect.\n",

Let us suppose that the world-line of a second point-electron passes through the world-point P₁. Let us determine P, Q, r as before, construct the middle-point M of the hyperbola of curvature at P, and finally the normal MN upon a line through P which is parallel to QP₁. With P as the initial point, we shall establish a system of reference in the following way: the t-axis will be laid along PQ, the x-axis in the direction of QP₁. The y-axis in the direction of MN, then the z-axis is automatically determined, as it is normal to the x-, y-, z-axes. Let [:x], [:y], [:z], [:t] be the acceleration-vector at P, [.x]₁, [.y]₁ [.z]₁, [.t]₁ be the velocity-vector at P₁.

      "In the mechanics reformed according to the world-postulate, the disharmonies which have disturbed the relations between Newtonian mechanics and modern electrodynamics automatically disappear. I shall now consider the position of the Newtonian law of attraction to this postulate. I will assume that two point-masses m and m₁ describe their world-lines; a moving force-vector is exercised by m upon m₁, and the expression is just the same as in the case of the electron, only we have to write +mm₁ instead -ee₁. We shall consider only the special case in which the acceleration-vector of m is always zero: then t may be introduced in such a manner that m may be regarded as fixed, the motion of m is now subjected to the moving-force vector of m alone. If we now modify this given vector by writing -([.]1/√(1-(v²/c²)) instead of [.t] ([.t] = 1 up to magnitudes of the order (1[.]/c²)), then it appears that Kepler’s laws hold good for the position (x₁, y₁, z₁), of m₁ at any time, only in place of the time t₁, we have to write the proper time τ₁ of m₁. On the basis of this simple remark, it can be seen that the proposed law of attraction in combination with new mechanics is not less suited for the explanation of astronomical phenomena than the Newtonian law of attraction in combination with Newtonian mechanics.\n",

In course of time, the mathematical consequences will be gradually deduced, and enough suggestions will be forthcoming for the experimental verification of the postulate; in this way even those, who find it uncongenial, or even painful to give up the old, time-honoured concepts, will be reconciled to the new ideas of time and space,—in the prospect that they will lead to pre-established harmony between pure mathematics and physics.\n",

The mathematical apparatus useful for the general relativity theory, lay already complete in the “Absolute Differential Calculus,” which were based on the researches of Gauss, Riemann and Christoffel on the non-Euclidean manifold, and which have been shaped into a system by Ricci and Levi-civita, and already applied to the problems of theoretical physics.

      "Principal considerations about the Postulate of Relativity.\n",
      "§ 1. Remarks on the Special Relativity Theory.\n",
      "The special relativity theory rests on the following postulate which also holds valid for the Galileo-Newtonian mechanics.\n",
      "If a co-ordinate system K be so chosen that when referred to it, the physical laws hold in their simplest forms these laws would be also valid when referred to another system of co-ordinates K′ which is subjected to an uniform translational motion relative to K. We call this postulate “The Special Relativity Principle.” By the word special, it is signified that the principle is limited to the case, when K′ has uniform translatory motion with reference to K, but the equivalence of K and K′ does not extend to the case of non-uniform motion of K′ relative to K.\n",
      "The Special Relativity Theory does not differ from the classical mechanics through the assumption of this postulate, but only through the postulate of the constancy of light-velocity in vacuum which, when combined with the special relativity postulate, gives in a well-known way, the relativity of synchronism as well as the Lorenz-transformation, with all the relations between moving rigid bodies and clocks.\n",
      "The modification which the theory of space and time has undergone through the special relativity theory, is indeed a profound one, but a weightier point remains untouched. According to the special relativity theory, the theorems of geometry are to be looked upon as the laws about any possible relative positions of solid bodies at rest, and more generally the theorems of kinematics, as theorems which describe the relation between measurable bodies and clocks. Consider two material points of a solid body at rest; then according to these conceptions there corresponds to these points a wholly definite extent of length, independent of kind, position, orientation and time of the body.\n",
      "Similarly let us consider two positions of the pointers of a clock which is at rest with reference to a co-ordinate system; then to these positions, there always corresponds, a time-interval of a definite length, independent of time and place. It would be soon shown that the general relativity theory can not hold fast to this simple physical significance of space and time.\n",
      "§ 2. About the reasons which explain the extension of the relativity-postulate.\n",
      "To the classical mechanics (no less than) to the special relativity theory, is attached an episteomological defect, which was perhaps first cleanly pointed out by E. Mach. We shall illustrate it by the following example; Let two fluid bodies of equal kind and magnitude swim freely in space at such a great distance from one another (and from all other masses) that only that sort of gravitational forces are to be taken into account which the parts of any of these bodies exert upon each other. The distance of the bodies from one another is invariable. The relative motion of the different parts of each body is not to occur. But each mass is seen to rotate by an observer at rest relative to the other mass round the connecting line of the masses with a constant angular velocity (definite relative motion for both the masses). Now let us think that the surfaces of both the bodies (S₁ and S₂) are measured with the help of measuring rods (relatively at rest); it is then found that the surface of S₁ is a sphere and the surface of the other is an ellipsoid of rotation. We now ask, why is this difference between the two bodies? An answer to this question can only then be regarded as satisfactory from the episteomological standpoint when the thing adduced as the cause is an observable fact of experience. The law of causality has the sense of a definite statement about the world of experience only when observable facts alone appear as causes and effects.\n",
      "The Newtonian mechanics does not give to this question any satisfactory answer. For example, it says:—The laws of mechanics hold true for a space R₁ relative to which the body S₁ is at rest, not however for a space relative to which S₂ is at rest.\n",
      "The Galiliean space, which is here introduced is however only a purely imaginary cause, not an observable thing. It is thus clear that the Newtonian mechanics does not, in the case treated here, actually fulfil the requirements of causality, but produces on the mind a fictitious complacency, in that it makes responsible a wholly imaginary cause R₁ for the different behaviours of the bodies S₁ and S₂ which are actually observable.\n",
      "A satisfactory explanation to the question put forward above can only be thus given:—that the physical system composed of S₁ and S₂ shows for itself alone no conceivable cause to which the different behaviour of S₁ and S₂ can be attributed. The cause must thus lie outside the system. We are therefore led to the conception that the general laws of motion which determine specially the forms of S₁ and S₂ must be of such a kind, that the mechanical behaviour of S₁ and S₂ must be essentially conditioned by the distant masses, which we had not brought into the system considered. These distant masses, (and their relative motion as regards the bodies under consideration) are then to be looked upon as the seat of the principal observable causes for the different behaviours of the bodies under consideration. They take the place of the imaginary cause R₁. Among all the conceivable spaces R₁ and R₂ moving in any manner relative to one another, there is a priori, no one set which can be regarded as affording greater advantages, against which the objection which was already raised from the standpoint of the theory of knowledge cannot be again revived. The laws of physics must be so constituted that they should remain valid for any system of co-ordinates moving in any manner. We thus arrive at an extension of the relativity postulate.\n",
      "Besides this momentous episteomological argument, there is also a well-known physical fact which speaks in favour of an extension of the relativity theory. Let there be a Galiliean co-ordinate system K relative to which (at least in the four-dimensional region considered) a mass at a sufficient distance from other masses move uniformly in a line. Let K′ be a second co-ordinate system which has a uniformly accelerated motion relative to K. Relative to K′ any mass at a sufficiently great distance experiences an accelerated motion such that its acceleration and the direction of acceleration is independent of its material composition and its physical conditions.\n",
      "Can any observer, at rest relative to K′, then conclude that he is in an actually accelerated reference-system? This is to be answered in the negative; the above-named behaviour of the freely moving masses relative to K′ can be explained in as good a manner in the following way. The reference-system K′ has no acceleration. In the space-time region considered there is a gravitation-field which generates the accelerated motion relative to K′.\n",
      "This conception is feasible, because to us the experience of the existence of a field of force (namely the gravitation field) has shown that it possesses the remarkable property of imparting the same acceleration to all bodies. The mechanical behaviour of the bodies relative to K′ is the same as experience would expect of them with reference to systems which we assume from habit as stationary; thus it explains why from the physical stand-point it can be assumed that the systems K and K′ can both with the same legitimacy be taken as at rest, that is, they will be equivalent as systems of reference for a description of physical phenomena.\n",
      "From these discussions we see, that the working out of the general relativity theory must, at the same time, lead to a theory of gravitation; for we can “create” a gravitational field by a simple variation of the co-ordinate system. Also we see immediately that the principle of the constancy of light-velocity must be modified, for we recognise easily that the path of a ray of light with reference to K′ must be, in general, curved, when light travels with a definite and constant velocity in a straight line with reference to K.\n",
      "§ 3. The time-space continuum. Requirements of the general Co-variance for the equations expressing the laws of Nature in general.\n",
      "In the classical mechanics as well as in the special relativity theory, the co-ordinates of time and space have an immediate physical significance; when we say that any arbitrary point has x₁ as its X₁ co-ordinate, it signifies that the projection of the point-event on the X₁-axis ascertained by means of a solid rod according to the rules of Euclidean Geometry is reached when a definite measuring rod, the unit rod, can be carried x₁ times from the origin of co-ordinates along the X₁ axis. A point having x₄ = t₁ as the X₄ co-ordinate signifies that a unit clock which is adjusted to be at rest relative to the system of co-ordinates, and coinciding in its spatial position with the point-event and set according to some definite standard has gone over x₄ = t periods before the occurrence of the point-event.\n",
      "This conception of time and space is continually present in the mind of the physicist, though often in an unconscious way, as is clearly recognised from the role which this conception has played in physical measurements. This conception must also appear to the reader to be lying at the basis of the second consideration of the last paragraph and imparting a sense to these conceptions. But we wish to show that we are to abandon it and in general to replace it by more general conceptions in order to be able to work out thoroughly the postulate of general relativity,—the case of special relativity appearing as a limiting case when there is no gravitation.\n",
      "We introduce in a space, which is free from Gravitation-field, a Galiliean Co-ordinate System K (x, y, z, t) and also, another system K′ (x′ y′ z′ t′) rotating uniformly relative to K. The origin of both the systems as well as their z-axes might continue to coincide. We will show that for a space-time measurement in the system K′, the above established rules for the physical significance of time and space can not be maintained. On grounds of symmetry it is clear that a circle round the origin in the XY plane of K, can also be looked upon as a circle in the plane (X′, Y′) of K′. Let us now think of measuring the circumference and the diameter of these circles, with a unit measuring rod (infinitely small compared with the radius) and take the quotient of both the results of measurement. If this experiment be carried out with a measuring rod at rest relatively to the Galiliean system K we would get π, as the quotient. The result of measurement with a rod relatively at rest as regards K′ would be a number which is greater than π. This can be seen easily when we regard the whole measurement-process from the system K and remember that the rod placed on the periphery suffers a Lorenz-contraction, not however when the rod is placed along the radius. Euclidean Geometry therefore does not hold for the system K′; the above fixed conceptions of co-ordinates which assume the validity of Euclidean Geometry fail with regard to the system K′. We cannot similarly introduce in K′ a time corresponding to physical requirements, which will be shown by all similarly prepared clocks at rest relative to the system K′. In order to see this we suppose that two similarly made clocks are arranged one at the centre and one at the periphery of the circle, and considered from the stationary system K. According to the well-known results of the special relativity theory it follows—(as viewed from K)—that the clock placed at the periphery will go slower than the second one which is at rest. The observer at the common origin of co-ordinates who is able to see the clock at the periphery by means of light will see the clock at the periphery going slower than the clock beside him. Since he cannot allow the velocity of light to depend explicitly upon the time in the way under consideration he will interpret his observation by saying that the clock on the periphery actually goes slower than the clock at the origin. He cannot therefore do otherwise than define time in such a way that the rate of going of a clock depends on its position.\n",
      "We therefore arrive at this result. In the general relativity theory time and space magnitudes cannot be so defined that the difference in spatial co-ordinates can be immediately measured by the unit-measuring rod, and time-like co-ordinate difference with the aid of a normal clock.\n",
      "The means hitherto at our disposal, for placing our co-ordinate system in the time-space continuum, in a definite way, therefore completely fail and it appears that there is no other way which will enable us to fit the co-ordinate system to the four-dimensional world in such a way, that by it we can expect to get a specially simple formulation of the laws of Nature. So that nothing remains for us but to regard all conceivable co-ordinate systems as equally suitable for the description of natural phenomena. This amounts to the following law:—\n",
      "That in general, Laws of Nature are expressed by means of equations which are valid for all co-ordinate systems, that is, which are covariant for all possible transformations. It is clear that a physics which satisfies this postulate will be unobjectionable from the standpoint of the general relativity postulate. Because among all substitutions there are, in every case, contained those, which correspond to all relative motions of the co-ordinate system (in three dimensions). This condition of general covariance which takes away the last remnants of physical objectivity from space and time, is a natural requirement, as seen from the following considerations. All our well-substantiated space-time propositions amount to the determination of space-time coincidences. If, for example, the event consisted in the motion of material points, then, for this last case, nothing else are really observable except the encounters between two or more of these material points. The results of our measurements are nothing else than well-proved theorems about such coincidences of material points, of our measuring rods with other material points, coincidences between the hands of a clock, dial-marks and point-events occurring at the same position and at the same time.\n",
      "The introduction of a system of co-ordinates serves no other purpose than an easy description of totality of such coincidences. We fit to the world our space-time variables (x₁ x₂ x₃ x₄) such that to any and every point-event corresponds a system of values of (x₁ x₂ x₃ x₄). Two coincident point-events correspond to the same value of the variables (x₁ x₂ x₃ x₄); i.e., the coincidence is characterised by the equality of the co-ordinates. If we now introduce any four functions (x′₁ x′₂ x′₃ x′₄) as co-ordinates, so that there is an unique correspondence between them, the equality of all the four co-ordinates in the new system will still be the expression of the space-time coincidence of two material points. As the purpose of all physical laws is to allow us to remember such coincidences, there is a priori no reason present, to prefer a certain co-ordinate system to another; i.e., we get the condition of general covariance.\n",

In this sense, we shall now introduce the following supposition; that for an infinitely small four-dimensional region, the relativity theory is valid in the special sense when the axes are suitably chosen.\n",

      "From the considerations in § 2 and § 3 it is clear, that from the physical stand-point the quantities gστ are to be looked upon as magnitudes which describe the gravitation-field with reference to the chosen system of axes. We assume firstly, that in a certain four-dimensional region considered, the special relativity theory is true for some particular choice of co-ordinates. The gστ’s then have the values given in (4). A free material point moves with reference to such a system uniformly in a straight-line. If we now introduce, by any substitution, the space-time co-ordinates x₁...x₄ then in the new system gμν’s are no longer constants, but functions of space and time. At the same time, the motion of a free point-mass in the new co-ordinates, will appear as curvilinear, and not uniform, in which the law of motion, will be independent of the nature of the moving mass-points. We can thus signify this motion as one under the influence of a gravitation field. We see that the appearance of a gravitation-field is connected with space-time variability of gστ’s. In the general case, we can not by any suitable choice of axes, make special relativity theory valid throughout any finite region. We thus deduce the conception that gστ’s describe the gravitational field. According to the general relativity theory, gravitation thus plays an exceptional rôle as distinguished from the others, specially the electromagnetic forces, in as much as the 10 functions gστ representing gravitation, define immediately the metrical properties of the four-dimensional region.\n",

It will be shown that in the solution, the invariant ds, given in equation (3) plays a fundamental rôle, which we, following Gauss’s Theory of Surfaces, style as the line-element.\n",
      "The fundamental idea of the general co-variant theory is this:—With reference to any co-ordinate system, let certain things (tensors) be defined by a number of functions of co-ordinates which are called the components of the tensor. There are now certain rules according to which the components can be calculated in a new system of co-ordinates, when these are known for the original system, and when the transformation connecting the two systems is known. The things herefrom designated as “Tensors” have further the property that the transformation equation of their components are linear and homogeneous; so that all the components in the new system vanish if they are all zero in the original system. Thus a law of Nature can be formulated by putting all the components of a tensor equal to zero so that it is a general co-variant equation; thus while we seek the laws of formation of the tensors, we also reach the means of establishing general co-variant laws.\n",

If Bμ and Cν are any two vectors, and if for every choice of them the inner product Aμν Bμ Cν is a scalar, then Aμν is a co-variant tensor. The last law holds even when there is the more special formulation, that with any arbitrary choice of the four-vector Bμ alone the scalar product Aμν Bμ Bν is a scalar, in which case we have the additional condition that Aμν satisfies the symmetry condition. According to the method given above, we prove the tensor character of (Aμν + Aνμ), from which on account of symmetry follows the tensor-character of Aμν. This law can easily be generalized in the case of co-variant and contravariant tensors of any rank.\n",
      "Finally, from what has been proved, we can deduce the following law which can be easily generalized for any kind of tensor: If the quantities Aμν Bν form a tensor of the first rank, when Bν is any arbitrarily chosen four-vector, then Aμν is a tensor of the second rank. If for example, Cμ is any four-vector, then owing to the tensor character of Aμν Bν, the inner product Aμν Cμ Bν is a scalar, both the four-vectors Cμ and Bν being arbitrarily chosen.

      "In the following, we differentiate gravitation-field from matter in the sense that everything besides the gravitation-field will be signified as matter; therefore the term includes not only matter in the usual sense, but also the electro-dynamic field. Our next problem is to seek the field-equations of gravitation in the absence of matter. For this we apply the same method as employed in the foregoing paragraph for the deduction of the equations of motion for material points. A special case in which the field-equations sought-for are evidently satisfied is that of the special relativity theory in which gμν’s have certain constant values. This would be the case in a certain finite region with reference to a definite co-ordinate system K₀. With reference to this system, all the components Bρμστ of the Riemann’s Tensor [equation 43] vanish. These vanish then also in the region considered, with reference to every other co-ordinate system.\n",

For it is clear that the gravitation-field generated by a material point in its own neighbourhood can never be transformed away by any choice of axes, i.e., it cannot be transformed to a case of constant gμν’s.\n",

The equation (51) teaches us how to introduce the energy-tensor (corresponding to the density of Poisson’s equation) in the field equations of gravitation. If we consider a complete system (for example the Solar-system) its total mass, as also its total gravitating action, will depend on the total energy of the system, ponderable as well as gravitational.

Still the question is not without formal interest, whether, when the energy-components of the gravitation-field and matter is defined in a generalised manner without any specialisation of co-ordinates, the laws of conservation have the form of the equation (56), and the field-equations of gravitation hold in the form (52) or (52a); such that on the left-hand side, we have a divergence in the usual sense, and on the right-hand side, the sum of the energy-components of matter and gravitation.

      "Consider a slab of matter moving with velocity ux along the x-axis, then even in a stationary field of electrostatic polarisation, that is, for a field in which δD/δt = 0, there will be some change in the polarisation of the body due to its motion, given by ux(δD/δx).

Thus the electromagnetic laws of Maxwell and Lorentz can be definitely proved “to be independent of the manner in which they are referred to two coordinate systems which have a uniform translatory motion relative to each other.” (See “Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” page 5.) Thus so far as the electromagnetic laws are concerned, the principle of relativity can be proved to be true.\n",
      "But it is not known whether this principle will remain true in the case of other physical laws. We can always proceed on the assumption that it does remain true. Thus it is always possible to construct physical laws in such a way that they retain their form when referred to moving coordinates. The ultimate ground for formulating physical laws in this way is merely a subjective conviction that the principle of relativity is universally true. There is no a priori logical necessity that it should be so. Hence the Principle of Relativity (so far as it is applied to phenomena other than electromagnetic) must be regarded as a postulate, which we have assumed to be true, but for which we cannot adduce any definite proof, until after the generalisation is made and its consequences tested in the light of actual experience.\n",

      "On the Constancy of the Velocity of Light.\n",
      "Page 12—refer also to page 6, of Einstein’s paper.\n",
      "One of the two fundamental Postulates of the Principle of Relativity is that the velocity of light should remain constant whether the source is moving or stationary. It follows that even if a radiant source S move with a velocity u, it should always remain the centre of spherical waves expanding outwards with velocity c.\n",
      "At first sight, it may not appear clear why the velocity should remain constant. Indeed according to the theory of Ritz, the velocity should become c + u, when the source of light moves towards the observer with the velocity u.\n",
      "Prof. de Sitter has given an astronomical argument for deciding between these two divergent views. Let us suppose there is a double star of which one is revolving about the common centre of gravity in a circular orbit. Let the observer be in the plane of the orbit, at a great distance Δ.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light emitted by the star when at the position A will be received by the observer after a time, Δ/(c + u) while the light emitted by the star when at the position B will be received after a time Δ/(c - u). Let T be the real half-period of the star. Then the observed half-period from B to A is approximately T - 2Δu/c² and from A to B is T + 2Δu/c². Now if 2uΔ/c² be comparable to T, then it is impossible that the observations should satisfy Kepler’s Law. In most of the spectroscopic binary stars, 2uΔ/c² are not only of the same order as T, but are mostly much larger. For example, if u = 100 km/sec, T = 8 days, Δ/c = 33 years (corresponding to an annual parallax of ·1″), then T - 2uΔ/c² = 0. The existence of the Spectroscopic binaries, and the fact that they follow Kepler’s Law is therefore a proof that c is not affected by the motion of the source.\n",

Instead of Minkowski’s space-time vector of the first kind, he uses the more expressive term ‘four-vector,’ thereby making it quite clear that it represents a directed quantity like a straight line, a force or a momentum, and has got 4 components, three in the direction of space-axes, and one in the direction of the time-axis.\n",

If the six-vector be of a special type, i.e., a piece of plane, then this vector of the third type denotes the parallelopiped formed of this four-vector and the complement of this piece of plane. In the general case, the product will be the geometric sum of two parallelopipeds, but it can always be represented by a four-vector of the 1st type. For two pieces of 3-space volumes can always be added together by the vectorial addition of their components. So by the addition of two 3-space volumes, we do not obtain a vector of a more general type, but one which can always be represented by a four-vector (loc. cit. p. 759). The state of affairs here is the same as in the ordinary vector calculus, where by the vector-multiplication of a vector of the first, and a vector of the second type (i.e., a polar vector), we obtain a vector of the first type (axial vector).

In the above-mentioned paper (Annalen der Physik, p. 649, Bd. 38) Sommerfeld has introduced the terms, Div (divergence), Rot (Rotation), Grad (gradient) as four-dimensional extensions of the corresponding three-dimensional operations in place of the general symbol lor. The physical significance of these operations will become clear when along with Minkowski’s method of treatment we also study the geometrical method of Sommerfeld.

LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.

      "Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\n",
      "Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.\n",
      "Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\n",
      "Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n",
      "The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\n",
      "The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n",
      "Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n",
      "Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\n",
      "The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n",
      "While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.\n",
      "International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n",
      "Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n",
      "Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\n",
      "Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n",
      "Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n",
      "Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.\n",
      "This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n",
